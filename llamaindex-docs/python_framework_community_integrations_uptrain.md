# Perform Evaluations on LlamaIndex with UpTrain
**Overview** : In this example, we will see how to use UpTrain with LlamaIndex. UpTrain ([github](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain) || [website](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain/) || [docs](https://docs.uptrain.ai/)) is an open-source platform to evaluate and improve GenAI applications. It provides grades for 20+ preconfigured checks (covering language, code, embedding use cases), performs root cause analysis on failure cases and gives insights on how to resolve them. More details on UpTrain’s evaluations can be found [here](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-built-evaluations-we-offer-).
**Problem** : As an increasing number of companies are graduating their LLM prototypes to production-ready applications, their RAG pipelines are also getting complex. Developers are utilising modules like QueryRewrite, Context ReRank, etc., to enhance the accuracy of their RAG systems.
With increasing complexity comes more points of failure.
  1. Advanced Evals are needed to evaluate the quality of these newer modules and determine if they actually improve the system’s accuracy.
  2. A robust experimentation framework is needed to systematically test different modules and make data-driven decisions.


**Solution** : UpTrain helps to solve for both:
  1. UpTrain provides a series of checks to evaluate the quality of generated response, retrieved-context as well as all the interim steps. The relevant checks are ContextRelevance, SubQueryCompleteness, ContextReranking, ContextConciseness, FactualAccuracy, ContextUtilization, ResponseCompleteness, ResponseConciseness, etc.
  2. UpTrain also allows you to experiment with different embedding models as well as have an “evaluate_experiments” method to compare different RAG configurations.


# How to go about it?
[Section titled “How to go about it?”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#how-to-go-about-it)
There are two ways you can use UpTrain with LlamaIndex:
  1. **Using the UpTrain Callback Handler** : This method allows you to seamlessly integrate UpTrain with LlamaIndex. You can simply add UpTrainCallbackHandler to your existing LlamaIndex pipeline and it will evaluate all components of your RAG pipeline. This is the recommended method as it is the easiest to use and provides you with dashboards and insights with minimal effort.
  2. **Using UpTrain’s EvalLlamaIndex** : This method allows you to use UpTrain to perform evaluations on the generated responses. You can use the EvalLlamaIndex object to generate responses for the queries and then perform evaluations on the responses. You can find a detailed tutorial on how to do this below. This method offers more flexibility and control over the evaluations, but requires more effort to set up and use.


# 1. Using the UpTrain Callback Handler 
[Section titled “1. Using the UpTrain Callback Handler ”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#1-using-the-uptrain-callback-handler)
The following three demonstrations explain how you can use UpTrain Callback Handler to evaluate different components of your RAG pipelines.
## 1. **RAG Query Engine Evaluations** :
[Section titled “1. RAG Query Engine Evaluations:”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#1-rag-query-engine-evaluations)
The RAG query engine plays a crucial role in retrieving context and generating responses. To ensure its performance and response quality, we conduct the following evaluations:
  * : Determines if the retrieved context has sufficient information to answer the user query or not.
  * : Assesses if the LLM’s response can be verified via the retrieved context.
  * : Checks if the response contains all the information required to answer the user query comprehensively.


## 2. **Sub-Question Query Generation Evaluation** :
[Section titled “2. Sub-Question Query Generation Evaluation:”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#2-sub-question-query-generation-evaluation)
The SubQuestionQueryGeneration operator decomposes a question into sub-questions, generating responses for each using an RAG query engine. To measure it’s accuracy, we use:
  * **[Sub Query Completeness](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/query-quality/sub-query-completeness)** : Assures that the sub-questions accurately and comprehensively cover the original query.


## 3. **Re-Ranking Evaluations** :
[Section titled “3. Re-Ranking Evaluations:”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#3-re-ranking-evaluations)
Re-ranking involves reordering nodes based on relevance to the query and choosing the top nodes. Different evaluations are performed based on the number of nodes returned after re-ranking.
a. Same Number of Nodes
  * : Checks if the order of re-ranked nodes is more relevant to the query than the original order.


b. Different Number of Nodes:
  * : Examines whether the reduced number of nodes still provides all the required information.


These evaluations collectively ensure the robustness and effectiveness of the RAG query engine, SubQuestionQueryGeneration operator, and the re-ranking process in the LlamaIndex pipeline.
#### **Note:**
[Section titled “Note:”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#note)
  * We have performed evaluations using a basic RAG query engine; the same evaluations can be performed using the advanced RAG query engine as well.
  * Same is true for Re-Ranking evaluations, we have performed evaluations using SentenceTransformerRerank, the same evaluations can be performed using other re-rankers as well.

# 2. Sub-Question Query Engine Evaluation
[Section titled “2. Sub-Question Query Engine Evaluation”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#2-sub-question-query-engine-evaluation)
The **sub-question query engine** is used to tackle the problem of answering a complex query using multiple data sources. It first breaks down the complex query into sub-questions for each relevant data source, then gathers all the intermediate responses and synthesizes a final response.
UpTrain callback handler will automatically capture the sub-question and the responses for each of them once generated and will run the following three evaluations _(Graded from 0 to 1)_ on the response:
  * : Determines if the retrieved context has sufficient information to answer the user query or not.
  * : Assesses if the LLM’s response can be verified via the retrieved context.
  * : Checks if the response contains all the information required to answer the user query comprehensively.


In addition to the above evaluations, the callback handler will also run the following evaluation:
  * **[Sub Query Completeness](https://docs.uptrain.ai/predefined-evaluations/query-quality/sub-query-completeness)** : Assures that the sub-questions accurately and comprehensively cover the original query.

# 3. Re-ranking
[Section titled “3. Re-ranking”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#3-re-ranking)
Re-ranking is the process of reordering the nodes based on their relevance to the query. There are multiple classes of re-ranking algorithms offered by Llamaindex. We have used LLMRerank for this example.
The re-ranker allows you to enter the number of top n nodes that will be returned after re-ranking. If this value remains the same as the original number of nodes, the re-ranker will only re-rank the nodes and not change the number of nodes. Otherwise, it will re-rank the nodes and return the top n nodes.
We will perform different evaluations based on the number of nodes returned after re-ranking.
## 3a. Re-ranking (With same number of nodes)
[Section titled “3a. Re-ranking (With same number of nodes)”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#3a-re-ranking-with-same-number-of-nodes)

## Make the list of queries
[Section titled “Make the list of queries”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#make-the-list-of-queries)
Before we can generate responses, we need to create a list of queries. Since the query engine is trained on New York City, we will create a list of queries related to New York City.
```


data =[




{"question": "What is the population of New York City?"},




{"question": "What is the area of New York City?"},




{"question": "What is the largest borough in New York City?"},




{"question": "What is the average temperature in New York City?"},

## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#setup-1)
UpTrain provides you with:
  1. Dashboards with advanced drill-down and filtering options
  2. Insights and common topics among failing cases
  3. Observability and real-time monitoring of production data
  4. Regression testing via seamless integration with your CI/CD pipelines


You can choose between the following two alternatives for evaluating using UpTrain:
# Alternative 1: Evaluate using UpTrain’s Open-Source Software (OSS)
[Section titled “Alternative 1: Evaluate using UpTrain’s Open-Source Software (OSS)”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#alternative-1-evaluate-using-uptrains-open-source-software-oss)
You can use the open-source evaluation service to evaluate your model. In this case, you will need to provide an OpenAI API key. You can get yours [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
In order to view your evaluations in the UpTrain dashboard, you will need to set it up by running the following commands in your terminal:
Terminal window```

## Create the EvalLlamaIndex object
[Section titled “Create the EvalLlamaIndex object”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#create-the-evalllamaindex-object)
Now that we have created the query engine, we can use it to create an EvalLlamaIndex object. This object will be used to generate responses for the queries.
```


llamaindex_object =EvalLlamaIndex(




settings=settings,query_engine=query_engine



```

## Run the evaluation
[Section titled “Run the evaluation”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#run-the-evaluation)
Now that we have the list of queries, we can use the EvalLlamaIndex object to generate responses for the queries and then perform evaluations on the responses. You can find an extensive list of the evaluations offered by UpTrain [here](https://docs.uptrain.ai/key-components/evals). We have chosen two that we found to be the most relevant for this tutorial:
  1. **Context Relevance** : This evaluation checks whether the retrieved context is relevant to the query. This is important because the retrieved context is used to generate the response. If the retrieved context is not relevant to the query, then the response will not be relevant to the query either.
  2. **Response Conciseness** : This evaluation checks whether the response is concise. This is important because the response should be concise and should not contain any unnecessary information.


```


results = llamaindex_object.evaluate(




project_name="uptrain-llama-index",




evaluation_name="nyc_wikipedia",# adding project and evaluation names allow you to track the results in the UpTrain dashboard

You can find an extensive list of the evaluations offered by UpTrain [here](https://docs.uptrain.ai/key-components/evals). We have chosen two that we found to be the most relevant for this tutorial:
  1. **Context Relevance** : This evaluation checks whether the retrieved context is relevant to the query. This is important because the retrieved context is used to generate the response. If the retrieved context is not relevant to the query, then the response will not be relevant to the query either.
  2. **Response Conciseness** : This evaluation checks whether the response is concise. This is important because the response should be concise and should not contain any unnecessary information.


```


results = llamaindex_object.evaluate(




project_name="uptrain-llama-index",




evaluation_name="nyc_wikipedia",# adding project and evaluation names allow you to track the results in the UpTrain dashboard




data=data,




checks=[Evals.CONTEXT_RELEVANCE, Evals.RESPONSE_CONCISENESS],



```

```


pd.DataFrame(results)


```

### Dashboards:
[Section titled “Dashboards:”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/community/integrations/uptrain/#dashboards)
Histogram of score vs number of cases with that score
You can filter failure cases and generate common topics among them. This can help identify the core issue and help fix it
