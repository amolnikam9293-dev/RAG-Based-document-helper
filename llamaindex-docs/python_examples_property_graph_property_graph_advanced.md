# Property Graph Construction with Predefined Schemas 
In this notebook, we walk through using Neo4j, Ollama and Huggingface to build a property graph.
Specifically, we will be using the `SchemaLLMPathExtractor` which allows us to specify an exact schema containing possible entity types, relation types, and defining how they can be connected together.
This is useful for when you have a specific graph you want to build, and want to limit what the LLM is predicting.
```


%pip install llama-index




%pip install llama-index-llms-ollama




%pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface



# Optional



%pip install llama-index-graph-stores-neo4j




%pip install llama-index-graph-stores-nebula

## Graph Construction
[Section titled “Graph Construction”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/property_graph/property_graph_advanced/#graph-construction)
To construct our graph, we are going to take advantage of the `SchemaLLMPathExtractor` to construct our graph.
Given some schema for a graph, we can extract entities and relations that follow this schema, rather than letting the LLM decide entities and relations at random.
```


import nest_asyncio





nest_asyncio.apply()


```

```


from typing import Literal




from llama_index.llms.ollama import Ollama




from llama_index.core.indices.property_graph import SchemaLLMPathExtractor




# best practice to use upper-case



entities = Literal["PERSON", "PLACE", "ORGANIZATION"]




relations = Literal["HAS", "PART_OF", "WORKED_ON", "WORKED_WITH", "WORKED_AT"]




# define which entities can have which relations



validation_schema = {




"PERSON": ["HAS", "PART_OF", "WORKED_ON", "WORKED_WITH", "WORKED_AT"],




"PLACE": ["HAS", "PART_OF", "WORKED_AT"],




"ORGANIZATION": ["HAS", "PART_OF", "WORKED_WITH"],






kg_extractor =SchemaLLMPathExtractor(




llm=Ollama(




model="llama3",




json_mode=True,




request_timeout=3600,




# Manually set the context window to limit memory usage




context_window=8000,





possible_entities=entities,




possible_relations=relations,




kg_validation_schema=validation_schema,




# if false, allows for values outside of the schema




# useful for using the schema as a suggestion




strict=True,



```

Now, You can use SimplePropertyGraph, Neo4j, or NebulaGraph to store the graph.
**Option 1. Neo4j**
To launch Neo4j locally, first ensure you have docker installed. Then, you can launch the database with the following docker command
Terminal window```


dockerrun\




-p7474:7474-p7687:7687\




-v$PWD/data:/data-v$PWD/plugins:/plugins\




--nameneo4j-apoc\




-eNEO4J_apoc_export_file_enabled=true\




-eNEO4J_apoc_import_file_enabled=true\




-eNEO4J_apoc_import_file_use__neo4j__config=true\




-eNEO4JLABS_PLUGINS=\[\"apoc\"\]\




neo4j:latest


```

From here, you can open the db at <http://localhost:7474/>. On this page, you will be asked to sign in. Use the default username/password of `neo4j` and `neo4j`.
Once you login for the first time, you will be asked to change the password.
After this, you are ready to create your first property graph!
```


from llama_index.graph_stores.neo4j import Neo4jPropertyGraphStore





graph_store =Neo4jPropertyGraphStore(




username="neo4j",




password="<password>",




url="bolt://localhost:7687",





vec_store =None


```

**Option 2. NebulaGraph**
To launch NebulaGraph locally, first ensure you have docker installed. Then, you can launch the database with the following docker command.
Terminal window```


mkdirnebula-docker-compose




cdnebula-docker-compose




curl--outputdocker-compose.yamlhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-docker-compose/master/docker-compose-lite.yaml




dockercomposeup


```

After this, you are ready to create your first property graph!
> Other options/details for deploying NebulaGraph can be found in the [docs](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/):
>   * [ad-hoc cluster in Google Colab](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/master/4.deployment-and-installation/2.compile-and-install-nebula-graph/8.deploy-nebula-graph-with-lite/).
>   * [Docker Desktop Extension](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/master/2.quick-start/1.quick-start-workflow/).
> 

```


from llama_index.graph_stores.nebula import NebulaPropertyGraphStore




from llama_index.core.vector_stores.simple import SimpleVectorStore





graph_store =NebulaPropertyGraphStore(




space="llamaindex_nebula_property_graph",overwrite=True





vec_store =SimpleVectorStore()


```

_If you want to explore the graph with NebulaGraph Jupyter extension_ , run the following commands. Or just skip them.
```


%pip install jupyter-nebulagraph


```

```

# load NebulaGraph Jupyter extension to enable %ngql magic



%load_ext ngql



# connect to NebulaGraph service



%ngql --address 127.0.0.1 --port 9669--user root --password nebula




%ngql CREATESPACEIFNOTEXISTSllamaindex_nebula_property_graph(vid_type=FIXED_STRING(256));


```

```

# use the graph space, which is similar to "use database" in MySQL


# The space was created in async way, so we need to wait for a while before using it, retry it if failed



%ngql USE llamaindex_nebula_property_graph;


```

**Start building!**
**NOTE:** Using a local model will be slower when extracting compared to API based models. Local models (like Ollama) are typically limited to sequential processing. Expect this to take about 10 minutes on an M2 Max.
```


from llama_index.core import PropertyGraphIndex




from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding





index = PropertyGraphIndex.from_documents(




documents,




kg_extractors=[kg_extractor],




embed_model=HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5"),




property_graph_store=graph_store,




vector_store=vec_store,




show_progress=True,



```

If we inspect the graph created, we can see that it only includes the relations and entity types that we defined!
```

# If using NebulaGraph Jupyter extension



%ngql MATCH p=()-[]->() RETURNLIMIT20;


```

```


%ng_draw


```

Or Neo4j:
For information on all `kg_extractors`, see [the documentation](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/module_guides/indexing/lpg_index_guide#construction).
## Querying
[Section titled “Querying”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/property_graph/property_graph_advanced/#querying)
Now that our graph is created, we can query it.
As is the theme with this notebook, we will be using a lower-level API and constructing all our retrievers ourselves!
```


from llama_index.core.indices.property_graph import (




LLMSynonymRetriever,




VectorContextRetriever,







llm_synonym =LLMSynonymRetriever(




index.property_graph_store,




llm=Ollama(




model="llama3",




request_timeout=3600,




# Manually set the context window to limit memory usage




context_window=8000,





include_text=False,





vector_context =VectorContextRetriever(




index.property_graph_store,




embed_model=HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5"),




include_text=False,



```

```


retriever = index.as_retriever(




sub_retrievers=[




llm_synonym,




vector_context,




```

```


nodes = retriever.retrieve("What happened at Interleaf?")





for node in nodes:




print(node.text)


```

```

Interleaf -> HAS -> Paul Graham


Interleaf -> HAS -> Emacs


Interleaf -> HAS -> Release Engineering


Interleaf -> HAS -> Viaweb


Interleaf -> HAS -> Y Combinator


Interleaf -> HAS -> impressive technology


Interleaf -> HAS -> smart people

```

We can also create a query engine with similar syntax.
```


query_engine = index.as_query_engine(




sub_retrievers=[




llm_synonym,




vector_context,





llm=Ollama(




model="llama3",




request_timeout=3600,




# Manually set the context window to limit memory usage




context_window=8000,







response = query_engine.query("What happened at Interleaf?")





print(str(response))


```

```

Paul Graham worked there, as well as other smart people. Emacs was also present.

```
