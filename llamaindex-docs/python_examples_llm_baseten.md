## Model APIs vs. Dedicated Deployments
[Section titled “Model APIs vs. Dedicated Deployments”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/baseten/#model-apis-vs-dedicated-deployments)
Baseten offers two main ways for inference.
  1. Model APIs are public endpoints for popular open source models (GPT-OSS, Kimi K2, DeepSeek etc) where you can directly use a frontier model via slug e.g. `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324` and you will be charged on a per-token basis. You can find the list of supported models here: <https://docs.baseten.co/development/model-apis/overview#supported-models>.
  2. Dedicated deployments are useful for serving custom models where you want to autoscale production workloads and have fine-grain configuration. You need to deploy a model in your Baseten dashboard and provide the 8 character model id like `abcd1234`.


By default, we set the `model_apis` parameter to `True`. If you want to use a dedicated deployment, you must set the `model_apis` parameter to `False` when instantiating the Baseten object.
#### Instantiation
[Section titled “Instantiation”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/baseten/#instantiation)
```

# Model APIs, you can find the model_slug here: https://docs.baseten.co/development/model-apis/overview#supported-models



llm =Baseten(




model_id="MODEL_SLUG",




api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",




model_apis=True,# Default, so not strictly necessary





# Dedicated Deployments, you can find the model_id by in the Baseten dashboard here: https://app.baseten.co/overview



llm =Baseten(




model_id="MODEL_ID",




api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",




model_apis=False,



```

#### Call `complete` with a prompt
[Section titled “Call complete with a prompt”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/baseten/#call-complete-with-a-prompt)
```


llm_response = llm.complete("Paul Graham is")




print(llm_response.text)


```

#### Call `chat` with a list of messages
[Section titled “Call chat with a list of messages”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/baseten/#call-chat-with-a-list-of-messages)
```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="system",content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(role="user",content="What is your name"),





resp = llm.chat(messages)


```

```


print(resp)


```

```

assistant: Arrr, matey! I be known as Captain Crimsonbeard—though me beard be more fiery red than crimson, truth be told! A pirate of legend, scourge of the seven memes, and connoisseur of questionable life choices. But ye can call me Cap’n if ye like, or "That Weird Pirate Who Won’t Stop Talking About Pineapples." Now, what mischief brings ye to me ship today? 🏴‍☠️🍍

# Async
[Section titled “Async”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/baseten/#async)
Async operations are used for long-running inference tasks that may hit request timeouts, batch inference jobs, and prioritizing certain requests.
(1) In the integation, `acomplete` async function is implemented using the aiohttp library, an asynchronous HTTP client in python. The function invokes the async_predict at the approriate Baseten model endpoint, then the user receives a response with the request_id if successful. The user can then check the status or cancel the async_predict request using the returned request_id.
(2) Once the model finishes executing the request, the async result will be posted to the user provided webhook endpoint. The user’s endpoint is responsible for validating the webhook signature for security, then processing and storing the output.
Baseten: Get request_id → result is posted to webhook
##### Note: Async is only available for dedicated deployments and not for model APIs. `achat` is not supported because chat does not make sense for async operations.
