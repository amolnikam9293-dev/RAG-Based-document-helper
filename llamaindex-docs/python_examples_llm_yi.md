## Fundamental Usage
[Section titled “Fundamental Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/yi/#fundamental-usage)
You will need to get an API key from [platform.01.ai](https://platform.01.ai/apikeys). Once you have one, you can either pass it explicity to the model, or use the `YI_API_KEY` environment variable.
The details are as follows
```


import os





os.environ["YI_API_KEY"] ="your api key"


```

#### Call `complete` with a prompt
[Section titled “Call complete with a prompt”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/yi/#call-complete-with-a-prompt)

from llama_index.llms.yi import Yi





llm =Yi(model="yi-large")




response = llm.complete("What is the capital of France?")




print(response)


```

```

The capital of France is Paris.

#### Call `chat` with a list of messages
[Section titled “Call chat with a list of messages”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/yi/#call-chat-with-a-list-of-messages)
```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage

print(r.delta,end="")


```

```
