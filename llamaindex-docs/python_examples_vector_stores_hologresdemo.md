# Hologres 
> [Hologres](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/hologres/) is a one-stop real-time data warehouse, which can support high performance OLAP analysis and high QPS online services.
To run this notebook you need a Hologres instance running in the cloud. You can get one following [this link](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/hologres/getting-started/purchase-a-hologres-instance#task-1918224).
After creating the instance, you should be able to figure out following configurations with [Hologres console](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/hologres/user-guide/instance-list?spm=a2c63.p38356.0.0.79b34766nhwskN)
```


test_hologres_config = {




"host": "<host>",




"port": 80,




"user": "<user>",




"password": "<password>",




"database": "<database>",




"table_name": "<table_name>",



```

By the way, you need to ensure you have `llama-index` installed:
```


%pip install llama-index-vector-stores-hologres


```

```


!pip install llama-index


```

What I Worked On



February 2021



Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined ma ...

### Create the AnalyticDB Vector Store object:
[Section titled “Create the AnalyticDB Vector Store object:”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/vector_stores/hologresdemo/#create-the-analyticdb-vector-store-object)
```


hologres_store = HologresVectorStore.from_param(

password=test_hologres_config["password"],




database=test_hologres_config["database"],




table_name=test_hologres_config["table_name"],




embedding_dimension=1536,




pre_delete_table=True,



```

### Build the Index from the Documents:
[Section titled “Build the Index from the Documents:”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/vector_stores/hologresdemo/#build-the-index-from-the-documents)
```


storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=hologres_store)





index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(




documents,storage_context=storage_context



```

### Query using the index:
[Section titled “Query using the index:”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/vector_stores/hologresdemo/#query-using-the-index)
```


query_engine = index.as_query_engine()




response = query_engine.query("Why did the author choose to work on AI?")





print(response.response)


```

```

The author was inspired to work on AI due to the influence of a science fiction novel, "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress," which featured an intelligent computer named Mike, and a PBS documentary showcasing Terry Winograd's use of the SHRDLU program. These experiences led the author to believe that creating intelligent machines was an imminent reality and sparked their interest in the field of AI.
