# Events
##  Event [#](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/workflows-api-reference/events/#workflows.events.Event "Permanent link")
Bases: `DictLikeModel`
Base class for all workflow events.
Events are light-weight, serializable payloads passed between steps. They support both attribute and mapping access to dynamic fields.
Examples:
Subclassing with typed fields:
```
frompydanticimport Field

classCustomEv(Event):
    score: int = Field(ge=0)

e = CustomEv(score=10)
print(e.score)

```

##  InputRequiredEvent [#](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/workflows-api-reference/events/#workflows.events.InputRequiredEvent "Permanent link")
Bases: 
Emitted when human input is required to proceed.
Automatically written to the event stream if returned from a step.
If returned from a step, it does not need to be consumed by other steps and will pass validation. It's expected that the caller will respond to this event and send back a [HumanResponseEvent](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/workflows-api-reference/events/#workflows.events.HumanResponseEvent "HumanResponseEvent").
Use this directly or subclass it.
Typical flow: a step returns `InputRequiredEvent`, callers consume it from the stream and send back a [HumanResponseEvent](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/workflows-api-reference/events/#workflows.events.HumanResponseEvent "HumanResponseEvent").
Examples:
```
fromworkflows.eventsimport InputRequiredEvent, HumanResponseEvent

classHITLWorkflow(Workflow):
    @step
    async defmy_step(self, ev: StartEvent) -> InputRequiredEvent:
        return InputRequiredEvent(prefix="What's your name? ")

    @step
    async defmy_step(self, ev: HumanResponseEvent) -> StopEvent:
        return StopEvent(result=ev.response)
