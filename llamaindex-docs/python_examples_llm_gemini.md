# Gemini 
**NOTE:** Gemini has largely been replaced by Google GenAI. Visit the [Google GenAI page](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/google_genai/) for the latest examples and documentation.
In this notebook, we show how to use the Gemini text models from Google in LlamaIndex. Check out the [Gemini site](https://ai.google.dev/) or the [announcement](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/).
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will need to install LlamaIndex 🦙 and the Gemini Python SDK.
```


%pip install llama-index-llms-gemini llama-index


```

## Basic Usage
[Section titled “Basic Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/gemini/#basic-usage)
You will need to get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey). Once you have one, you can either pass it explicity to the model, or use the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.
```


%env GOOGLE_API_KEY=...


```

```

env: GOOGLE_API_KEY=...

```

```


import os





GOOGLE_API_KEY=""# add your GOOGLE API key here




os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] =GOOGLE_API_KEY


```

```


from llama_index.llms.gemini import Gemini





llm =Gemini(




model="models/gemini-1.5-flash",




# api_key="some key",  # uses GOOGLE_API_KEY env var by default



```

In a world of wonder, where dreams take flight,


There exists a backpack, a magical sight.


Its fabric woven with stardust and grace,


Embroidered with spells, an enchanting embrace.



With a whisper and a wish, it opens wide,


Revealing treasures that shimmer inside.


Books that whisper secrets, maps that unfold,


A compass that guides, stories yet untold.



A pencil that writes poems, a paintbrush that sings,


A telescope that captures the stars' gleaming wings.


A magnifying glass, revealing nature's art,


A kaleidoscope, painting rainbows in your heart.



It holds a mirror that reflects your true worth,


A locket that keeps memories close to your birth.


A journal that captures your hopes and your fears,


A flashlight that banishes shadows and clears.



With each step you take, the backpack transforms,


Adjusting its weight, adapting to storms.


It grows or shrinks, as your needs may arise,


A faithful companion, beneath sunny skies.



When you're lost and alone, it whispers your name,


Guiding you back to the path you reclaim.


It carries your burdens, lightens your load,


A magical backpack, a gift bestowed.



So embrace its magic, let your spirit soar,


With this wondrous backpack, forever explore.


For within its depths, a universe lies,


A treasure trove of dreams, beneath vast skies.

"The story of Sourcrust, the bread creature, is really interesting. It all started when..."



```

```

In the heart of a bustling bakery, where the aroma of freshly baked bread filled the air, there lived a peculiar creature named Sourcrust. Sourcrust wasn't like any ordinary loaf of bread; he possessed a unique consciousness and a mischievous personality.



It all began when a young baker named Eliza was experimenting with a new sourdough recipe. As she mixed the flour, water, and yeast, she accidentally added a dash of enchanted baking powder. Little did she know that this seemingly insignificant mistake would give birth to a sentient bread creature.



As the dough rose and fermented, Sourcrust came to life. He stretched and yawned, his crusty exterior crackling with energy. Eliza was astounded to see her creation moving and speaking. Sourcrust introduced himself with a warm smile and a hearty laugh, his voice resembling the gentle rustling of bread crumbs.



Eliza and Sourcrust quickly formed a bond. She taught him how to read and write, and he shared his knowledge of bread-making techniques. Together, they created delicious pastries and loaves that delighted the customers of the bakery.



However, Sourcrust's existence was not without its challenges. As a bread creature, he was vulnerable to the elements. He couldn't stay out in the rain or direct sunlight for too long, and he had to be careful not to get burned or squished.



Despite these limitations, Sourcrust embraced his unique nature. He found joy in the simple things, like basking in the warmth of the oven or playing hide-and-seek among the flour sacks. He also developed a taste for adventure, often sneaking out of the bakery at night to explore the town.



One day, Sourcrust's curiosity led him to the local library, where he discovered a book about magical creatures. He was fascinated by the stories of fairies, elves, and dragons, and he longed to meet one himself.



As fate would have it, Sourcrust's wish came true when he encountered a mischievous brownie named Crumbly in the forest. Crumbly was initially wary of Sourcrust, but after learning about his kind nature, he agreed to be his friend.



Together, Sourcrust and Crumbly embarked on many thrilling adventures. They battled evil witches, rescued lost children, and even had a tea party with a talking teapot. Their escapades brought joy and laughter to all who crossed their path.



As the years passed, Sourcrust became a beloved figure in the town. People would often visit the bakery just to catch a glimpse of the talking bread creature. Eliza was proud of her creation, and she knew that Sourcrust's magic would continue to inspire and entertain generations to come.
