# Ollama - Gemma 
## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/ollama_gemma/#setup)
First, follow the [readme](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) to set up and run a local Ollama instance.
[Gemma](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemma-open-models/): a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models built by Google DeepMind. Available in 2b and 7b parameter sizes
[Ollama](https://ollama.com/library/gemma): Support both 2b and 7b models
Note: `please install ollama>=0.1.26` You can download pre-release version here [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/releases/tag/v0.1.26)
When the Ollama app is running on your local machine:
  * All of your local models are automatically served on localhost:11434
  * Select your model when setting llm = Ollama(…, model=”:”)
  * Increase defaullt timeout (30 seconds) if needed setting Ollama(…, request_timeout=300.0)
  * If you set llm = Ollama(…, model=“<model family”) without a version it will simply look for latest


If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
```


!pip install llama-index-llms-ollama


```

```


!pip install llama-index


```

```


from llama_index.llms.ollama import Ollama


```

```


gemma_2b =Ollama(model="gemma:2b",request_timeout=30.0)




gemma_7b =Ollama(model="gemma:7b",request_timeout=30.0)


```

```


resp = gemma_2b.complete("Who is Paul Graham?")




print(resp)
