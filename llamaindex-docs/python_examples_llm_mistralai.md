## Function Calling
[Section titled “Function Calling”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/mistralai/#function-calling)
`mistral-large` supports native function calling. There’s a seamless integration with LlamaIndex tools, through the `predict_and_call` function on the `llm`.
This allows the user to attach any tools and let the LLM decide which tools to call (if any).
If you wish to perform tool calling as part of an agentic loop, check out our [agent guides](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/module_guides/deploying/agents/) instead.
**NOTE** : If you use another Mistral model, we will use a ReAct prompt to attempt to call the function. Your mileage may vary.
```


from llama_index.llms.mistralai import MistralAI




from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool






defmultiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:




"""Multiple two integers and returns the result integer"""




return* b






defmystery(a: int, b: int) -> int:




"""Mystery function on two integers."""




return*++ b






mystery_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults=mystery)




multiply_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults=multiply)





llm =MistralAI(model="mistral-large-latest")


```

```


response = llm.predict_and_call(




[mystery_tool, multiply_tool],




user_msg="What happens if I run the mystery function on 5 and 7",



```

```


print(str(response))


```

```


response = llm.predict_and_call(




[mystery_tool, multiply_tool],




user_msg=(




"""What happens if I run the mystery function on the following pairs of numbers? Generate a separate result for each row:



- 1 and 2


- 8 and 4



- 100 and 20 \



"""




allow_parallel_tool_calls=True,



```

```


print(str(response))


```

```





2120

```

```


forin response.sources:




print(f"Name: {s.tool_name}, Input: {s.raw_input}, Output: (s)}")


```

```

Name: mystery, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'a': 1, 'b': 2}}, Output: 5


Name: mystery, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'a': 8, 'b': 4}}, Output: 44


Name: mystery, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'a': 100, 'b': 20}}, Output: 2120

```

You get the same result if you use the `async` variant (it will be faster since we do asyncio.gather under the hood).
```


response =await llm.apredict_and_call(




[mystery_tool, multiply_tool],




user_msg=(




"""What happens if I run the mystery function on the following pairs of numbers? Generate a separate result for each row:



- 1 and 2


- 8 and 4



- 100 and 20 \



"""




allow_parallel_tool_calls=True,





forin response.sources:




print(f"Name: {s.tool_name}, Input: {s.raw_input}, Output: (s)}")


```

```

Name: mystery, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'a': 1, 'b': 2}}, Output: 5


Name: mystery, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'a': 8, 'b': 4}}, Output: 44


Name: mystery, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'a': 100, 'b': 20}}, Output: 2120

```

## Structured Prediction
[Section titled “Structured Prediction”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/mistralai/#structured-prediction)
An important use case for function calling is extracting structured objects. LlamaIndex provides an intuitive interface for converting any LLM into a structured LLM - simply define the target Pydantic class (can be nested), and given a prompt, we extract out the desired object.
```


from llama_index.llms.mistralai import MistralAI




from llama_index.core.prompts import PromptTemplate




from llama_index.core.bridge.pydantic import BaseModel






classRestaurant(BaseModel):




"""A restaurant with name, city, and cuisine."""





name: str




city: str




cuisine: str






llm =MistralAI(model="mistral-large-latest")




prompt_tmpl =PromptTemplate(




"Generate a restaurant in a given city {city_name}"





# Option 1: Use `as_structured_llm`



restaurant_obj = (




llm.as_structured_llm(Restaurant)




.complete(prompt_tmpl.format(city_name="Miami"))




.raw




# Option 2: Use `structured_predict`


# restaurant_obj = llm.structured_predict(Restaurant, prompt_tmpl, city_name="Miami")

```

```

restaurant_obj

```

```

Restaurant(name='Miami', city='Miami', cuisine='Cuban')

```

#### Structured Prediction with Streaming
[Section titled “Structured Prediction with Streaming”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/mistralai/#structured-prediction-with-streaming)
Any LLM wrapped with `as_structured_llm` supports streaming through `stream_chat`.
```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage




from IPython.display import clear_output




from pprint import pprint





input_msg = ChatMessage.from_str("Generate a restaurant in Miami")





sllm = llm.as_structured_llm(Restaurant)




stream_output = sllm.stream_chat([input_msg])




for partial_output in stream_output:




clear_output(wait=True)




pprint(partial_output.raw.dict())




restaurant_obj = partial_output.raw




restaurant_obj

```

## Async
[Section titled “Async”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/mistralai/#async)
```


from llama_index.llms.mistralai import MistralAI





llm =MistralAI()




resp =await llm.acomplete("Paul Graham is ")


```

```


print(resp)


```

```
