# `LlamaDataset` Submission Template Notebook 
This notebook serves as a template for creating a particular kind of `LlamaDataset`, namely `LabelledRagDataset`. Additionally, this template aids in the preparation of all of the necessary supplementary materials in order to make a `LlamaDataset` contribution to [llama-hub](https://llamahub.ai).
**NOTE** : Since this notebook uses OpenAI LLM’s as a default, an `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required. You can pass the `OPENAI_API_KEY` by specifying the `api_key` argument when constructing the LLM. Or by running `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<api_key>` before spinning up this jupyter notebook.
### Prerequisites
[Section titled “Prerequisites”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#prerequisites)
#### Fork and Clone Required Github Repositories
[Section titled “Fork and Clone Required Github Repositories”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#fork-and-clone-required-github-repositories)
Contributing a `LlamaDataset` to `llama-hub` is similar to contributing any of the other `llama-hub` artifacts (`LlamaPack`, `Tool`, `Loader`), in that you’ll be required to make a contribution to the [llama-hub repository](https://github.com/run-llama/llama-hub). However, unlike for those other artifacts, for a `LlamaDataset`, you’ll also be required to make a contribution to another Github repository, namely the [llama-datasets repository](https://github.com/run-llama/llama-datasets).
  1. Fork and clone `llama-hub` Github repository


Terminal window```


gitclonegit@github.com:<your-github-user-name>/llama-hub.git# for ssh




gitclonehttps://github.com/<your-github-user-name>/llama-hub.git# for https


```

  1. Fork and clone `llama-datasets` Github repository. **NOTE** : this is a Github LFS repository, and so, when cloning the repository **please ensure that you prefix the clone command with** `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1` in order to not download any of the large data files.


Terminal window```

# for bash



GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1gitclonegit@github.com:<your-github-user-name>/llama-datasets.git# for ssh




GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1gitclonehttps://github.com/<your-github-user-name>/llama-datasets.git# for https




# for windows its done in two commands



setGIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1




gitclonegit@github.com:<your-github-user-name>/llama-datasets.git# for ssh





setGIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1

#### A Quick Primer on `LabelledRagDataset` and `LabelledRagDataExample`
[Section titled “A Quick Primer on LabelledRagDataset and LabelledRagDataExample”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#a-quick-primer-on-labelledragdataset-and-labelledragdataexample)
A `LabelledRagDataExample` is a Pydantic `BaseModel` that contains the following fields:
  * `query` representing the question or query of the example
  * `query_by` notating whether the query was human generated or ai generated
  * `reference_answer` representing the reference (ground-truth) answer to the query
  * `reference_answer_by` notating whether the reference answer was human generated or ai generated
  * `reference_contexts` an optional list of text strings representing the contexts used in generating the reference answer


A `LabelledRagDataset` is also a Pydantic `BaseModel` that contains the lone field:
  * `examples` is a list of `LabelledRagDataExample`’s


In other words a `LabelledRagDataset` is comprised of a list of `LabelledRagDataExample`’s. Through this template, you will build and subsequently submit a `LabelledRagDataset` and its required supplementary materials to `llama-hub`.
## Steps For Making A `LlamaDataset` Submission
[Section titled “Steps For Making A LlamaDataset Submission”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#steps-for-making-a-llamadataset-submission)
(NOTE: these links are only functional while in the notebook.)
  1. Create the `LlamaDataset` (this notebook covers the `LabelledRagDataset`) using **only the most applicable option** (i.e., one) of the three listed below: 
    1. [From scratch and synthetically constructed examples](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#1A)
    2. [From an existing and similarly structured question-answer dataset](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#1B)
    3. [From scratch and manually constructed examples](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#1C)
  2. [Generate a baseline evaluation result](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#Step2)
  3. [Prepare `card.json` and `README.md`](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#Step3) by doing **only one** of either of the listed options below: 
    1. [Automatic generation with `LlamaDatasetMetadataPack`](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#3A)
    2. [Manual generation](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#3B)
  4. [Submit a pull-request into the `llama-hub` repository to register the `LlamaDataset`](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#Step4)
  5. [Submit a pull-request into the `llama-datasets` repository to upload the `LlamaDataset` and its source files](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#Step5)


## 1A. Creating a `LabelledRagDataset` from scratch with synthetically constructed examples
[Section titled “1A. Creating a LabelledRagDataset from scratch with synthetically constructed examples”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#1a-creating-a-labelledragdataset-from-scratch-with-synthetically-constructed-examples)
Use the code template below to construct your examples from scratch and synthetic data generation. In particular, we load a source text as a set of `Document`’s, and then use an LLM to generate question and answer pairs to construct our dataset.

Use the code template below to construct your examples from scratch. This method for creating a `LablledRagDataset` is the least scalable out of all the methods shown here. Nonetheless, we include it in this guide for completeness sake, but rather recommend that you use one of two the previous methods instead. Similar to the demonstration for [1A](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#1A), we consider the Paul Graham Essay dataset here as well.

What I Worked On



February 2021



Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn't write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.



The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called "data processing." This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district's 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was lik

## 2. Generate A Baseline Evaluation Result
[Section titled “2. Generate A Baseline Evaluation Result”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#2-generate-a-baseline-evaluation-result)
Submitting a dataset also requires submitting a baseline result. At a high-level, generating a baseline result comprises of the following steps:
```

i. Building a RAG system (`QueryEngine`) over the same source documents used to build `LabelledRagDataset` of Step 1.


ii. Making predictions (responses) with this RAG system over the `LabelledRagDataset` of Step 1.


iii. Evaluating the predictions

```

It is recommended to carry out Steps ii. and iii. via the `RagEvaluatorPack` which can be downloaded from `llama-hub`.
**NOTE** : The `RagEvaluatorPack` uses GPT-4 by default as it is an LLM that has demonstrated high alignment with human evaluations.
#### Demonstration
[Section titled “Demonstration”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#demonstration-3)
This is a demo for 1A, but it would follow similar steps for 1B and 1C.

## 3. Prepare `card.json` and `README.md`
[Section titled “3. Prepare card.json and README.md”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#3-prepare-cardjson-and-readmemd)
Submitting a dataset includes the submission of some metadata as well. This metadata lives in two different files, `card.json` and `README.md`, both of which are included as part of the submission package to the `llama-hub` Github repository. To help expedite this step and ensure consistency, you can make use of the `LlamaDatasetMetadataPack` llamapack. Alternatively, you can do this step manually following the demonstration and using the templates provided below.

#### `README.md`
[Section titled “README.md”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#readmemd)
In this step, the minimum requirement is to take the template below and fill in the necessary items, which amounts to changing the name of the dataset to the one you’d like to use for your new submission.
#### Demonstration
[Section titled “Demonstration”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#demonstration-6)
Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama-hub/main/llama_hub/llama_datasets/paul_graham_essay/README.md) for an example `README.md`.
#### Template
[Section titled “Template”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/ragdataset_submission_template/#template-6)
Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama-hub/main/llama_hub/llama_datasets/template_README.md) for a template of `README.md`. Simply copy and paste the contents of that file and replace the placeholders “[NAME]” and “[NAME-CAMELCASE]” with the appropriate values according to your new dataset name choice. For example:
  * “{NAME}” = “Paul Graham Essay Dataset”
  * “{NAME_CAMELCASE}” = PaulGrahamEssayDataset
