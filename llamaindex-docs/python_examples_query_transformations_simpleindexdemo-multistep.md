# Multi-Step Query Engine 
We have a multi-step query engine that’s able to decompose a complex query into sequential subquestions. This guide walks you through how to set it up!
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
```


%pip install llama-index-llms-openai


```

```


!pip install llama-index


```

#### Download Data
[Section titled “Download Data”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_transformations/simpleindexdemo-multistep/#download-data)
```


!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'




!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'-O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'


```

#### Load documents, build the VectorStoreIndex
