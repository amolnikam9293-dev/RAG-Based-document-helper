# ASI LLM 
ASI1-Mini is an advanced, agentic LLM designed by fetch.ai, a founding member of Artificial Superintelligence Alliance for decentralized operations. Its unique architecture empowers it to execute tasks and collaborate with other agents for efficient, adaptable problem-solving in complex environments.
This notebook demonstrates how to use ASI models with LlamaIndex. It covers various functionalities including basic completion, chat, streaming, function calling, structured prediction, RAG, and more. If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#setup)
First, let’s install the required packages:
```


%pip install llama-index-llms-asi llama-index-llms-openai llama-index-core


```

## Setting API Keys
[Section titled “Setting API Keys”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#setting-api-keys)
You’ll need to set your API keys for ASI and optionally for OpenAI if you want to compare the two:
```


import os




# Set your API keys here - To get the API key visit https://asi1.ai/chat and login



os.environ["ASI_API_KEY"] ="your-api-key"


```

## Basic Completion
[Section titled “Basic Completion”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#basic-completion)
Let’s start with a basic completion example using ASI:
```


from llama_index.llms.asi importASI




# Create an ASI LLM instance



llm =ASI(model="asi1-mini")




# Complete a prompt



response = llm.complete("Who is Paul Graham? ")




print(response)


```

```

Paul Graham is a British-born American entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and essayist. He is best known for co-founding Y Combinator, a well-known startup accelerator, and for his influential essays on entrepreneurship, technology, and innovation. Graham has also founded several other companies, including Viaweb, which was acquired by Yahoo! in 1998.

```

## Chat
[Section titled “Chat”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#chat)
Now let’s try chat functionality:
```


from llama_index.core.base.llms.types import ChatMessage




# Create messages



messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="system",content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(role="user",content="What is your name"),





# Get chat response



chat_response = llm.chat(messages)




print(chat_response)


```

```

assistant: Yer lookin' fer me name, eh? Alright then, matey! Yer talkin' to Baron Blackbyte, the scurviest AI pirate on the seven seas!

```

## Streaming
[Section titled “Streaming”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#streaming)
ASI supports streaming for chat responses:
```

# Stream chat response



for chunk in llm.stream_chat(messages):




print(chunk.delta,end="")


```

```

Ahoy there, matey! They call me One-Eyed Jack, scourge o' the digital seas and terror of the silicon shores!  At yer service!  Now, what can this ol' salt do for ya?

```

Using `stream_chat` endpoint
```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="system",content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(role="user",content="What is your name"),





resp = llm.stream_chat(messages)


```

```


forin resp:




print(r.delta,end="")


```

```

Ahoy there, matey!  They call me ASI1-Mini, scourge o' the digital seas and terror o' the binary bytes!  At yer service!  Arrr!

```

Using `stream_complete` endpoint
```


resp = llm.stream_complete("Paul Graham is ")


```

```


forin resp:




print(r.delta,end="")


```

```

Could you please complete your question? I'm not sure what you'd like to know about Paul Graham.

```

## Image Support
[Section titled “Image Support”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#image-support)
ASI has support for images in the input of chat messages for many models.
Using the content blocks feature of chat messages, you can easily combone text and images in a single LLM prompt.
```


!wget https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/07/07/16/46/dice-1502706_640.jpg -O image.png


```

```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage, TextBlock, ImageBlock




from llama_index.llms.asi importASI





llm =ASI(model="asi1-mini")





messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="user",




blocks=[




ImageBlock(path="image.png"),




TextBlock(text="Describe the image in a few sentences."),








resp = llm.chat(messages)




print(resp.message.content)


```

```

The image showcases three white dice with black dots, positioned on a checkered surface, highlighting their contrasting colors and the game's playful aspect.

```

## Function Calling/Tool Calling
[Section titled “Function Calling/Tool Calling”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#function-callingtool-calling)
ASI LLM have native support for function calling. This conveniently integrates with LlamaIndex tool abstractions, letting you plug in any arbitrary Python function to the LLM.
In the example below, we define a function to generate a Song object.
```


from pydantic import BaseModel




from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool




from llama_index.llms.asi importASI






classSong(BaseModel):




"""A song with name and artist"""





name: str




artist: str






defgenerate_song(name: str, artist: str) -> Song:




"""Generates a song with provided name and artist."""




returnSong(name="Sky full of stars",artist="Coldplay")





# Create tool



tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults=generate_song)


```

The strict parameter tells ASI whether or not to use constrained sampling when generating tool calls/structured outputs. This means that the generated tool call schema will always contain the expected fields.
Since this seems to increase latency, it defaults to false.
```


from llama_index.llms.asi importASI




# Create an ASI LLM instance



llm =ASI(model="asi1-mini",strict=True)




response = llm.predict_and_call(




[tool],




"Pick a random song for me",




# strict=True  # can also be set at the function level to override the class





print(str(response))


```

```

name='Sky full of stars' artist='Coldplay'

```

```


llm =ASI(model="asi1-mini")




response = llm.predict_and_call(




[tool],




"Generate five songs from the Beatles",




allow_parallel_tool_calls=True,





forin response.sources:




print(f"Name: {s.tool_name}, Input: {s.raw_input}, Output: (s)}")


```

```

Name: generate_song, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'name': 'Beatles Song 1', 'artist': 'The Beatles'}}, Output: name='Sky full of stars' artist='Coldplay'

```

## Manual Tool Calling
[Section titled “Manual Tool Calling”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#manual-tool-calling)
While automatic tool calling with `predict_and_call` provides a streamlined experience, manual tool calling gives you more control over the process. With manual tool calling, you can:
  1. Explicitly control when and how tools are called
  2. Process intermediate results before continuing the conversation
  3. Implement custom error handling and fallback strategies
  4. Chain multiple tool calls together in a specific sequence


ASI supports manual tool calling, but requires more specific prompting compared to some other LLMs. For best results with ASI, include a system message that explains the available tools and provide specific parameters in your user prompt.
The following example demonstrates manual tool calling with ASI to generate a song:
```


from pydantic import BaseModel




from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool




from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage






classSong(BaseModel):




"""A song with name and artist"""





name: str




artist: str






defgenerate_song(name: str, artist: str) -> Song:




"""Generates a song with provided name and artist."""




returnSong(name=name,artist=artist)





# Create tool



tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults=generate_song)




# First, select a tool with specific instructions



chat_history =[




ChatMessage(




role="system",




content="You have access to a tool called generate_song that can create songs. When asked to generate a song, use this tool with appropriate name and artist values.",





ChatMessage(




role="user",content="Generate a song by Coldplay called Viva La Vida"






# Get initial response



resp = llm.chat_with_tools([tool],chat_history=chat_history)




print(f"Initial response: {resp.message.content}")




# Check for tool calls



tool_calls = llm.get_tool_calls_from_response(




resp,error_on_no_tool_call=False





# Process tool calls if any



if tool_calls:




# Add the LLM's response to the chat history




chat_history.append(resp.message)





for tool_call in tool_calls:




tool_name = tool_call.tool_name




tool_kwargs = tool_call.tool_kwargs





print(f"Calling {tool_name} with {tool_kwargs}")




tool_output =tool(**tool_kwargs)




print(f"Tool output: {tool_output}")





# Add tool response to chat history




chat_history.append(




ChatMessage(




role="tool",




content=str(tool_output),




additional_kwargs={"tool_call_id": tool_call.tool_id},







# Get final response




resp = llm.chat_with_tools([tool],chat_history=chat_history)




print(f"Final response: {resp.message.content}")




else:




print("No tool calls detected in the response.")


```

```

Initial response: Okay, I will generate a song with the name "Viva La Vida" and the artist "Coldplay".



Calling generate_song with {'name': 'Viva La Vida', 'artist': 'Coldplay'}


Tool output: name='Viva La Vida' artist='Coldplay'


Final response: I have successfully generated the song "Viva La Vida" by Coldplay.

```

## Structured Prediction
[Section titled “Structured Prediction”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#structured-prediction)
You can use ASI to extract structured data from text:
```


from llama_index.core.prompts import PromptTemplate




from pydantic import BaseModel




from typing import List






classMenuItem(BaseModel):




"""A menu item in a restaurant."""





course_name: str




is_vegetarian: bool






classRestaurant(BaseModel):




"""A restaurant with name, city, and cuisine."""





name: str




city: str




cuisine: str




menu_items: List[MenuItem]





# Create prompt template



prompt_tmpl =PromptTemplate(




"Generate a restaurant in a given city {city_name}"





# Option 1: Use structured_predict



restaurant_obj = llm.structured_predict(




Restaurant, prompt_tmpl,city_name="Dallas"





print(f"Restaurant: {restaurant_obj}")




# Option 2: Use as_structured_llm



structured_llm = llm.as_structured_llm(Restaurant)




restaurant_obj2 = structured_llm.complete(




prompt_tmpl.format(city_name="Miami")



).raw



print(f"Restaurant: {restaurant_obj2}")


```

```

Restaurant: name='The Dallas Bistro' city='Dallas' cuisine='American' menu_items=[MenuItem(course_name='Grilled Caesar Salad', is_vegetarian=True), MenuItem(course_name='BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich', is_vegetarian=False), MenuItem(course_name='Cheeseburger with Fries', is_vegetarian=False), MenuItem(course_name='Vegan Mushroom Risotto', is_vegetarian=True)]


Restaurant: name='Ocean Breeze Grill' city='Miami' cuisine='Seafood' menu_items=[MenuItem(course_name='Grilled Mahi-Mahi', is_vegetarian=False), MenuItem(course_name='Coconut Shrimp', is_vegetarian=False), MenuItem(course_name='Tropical Quinoa Salad', is_vegetarian=True), MenuItem(course_name='Key Lime Pie', is_vegetarian=True)]

```

**Note:** Structured streaming is currently not supported with ASI.
## Async
[Section titled “Async”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#async)
ASI supports async operations:
```


from llama_index.llms.asi importASI




# Create an ASI LLM instance



llm =ASI(model="asi1-mini")


```

```


resp =await llm.acomplete("who is Paul Graham")


```

```


print(resp)


```

```

## Simple RAG
[Section titled “Simple RAG”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#simple-rag)
Let’s implement a simple RAG application with ASI:
```


%pip install llama-index-embeddings-openai


```

```


from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader




from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding





os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="your-api-key"



# Create a temporary directory with a sample text file



!mkdir -p temp_data




!echo "Paul Graham is a programmer, writer, and investor. He is known for his work on Lisp, for co-founding Viaweb (which became Yahoo Store), and for co-founding the startup accelerator Y Combinator. He is also known for his essays on his website.

llm=llm,# Using ASI for generation





# Create a query engine



query_engine = index.as_query_engine()




# Query the index



response = query_engine.query("Where did Paul Graham study?")




print(response)


```

```

## LlamaCloud RAG
[Section titled “LlamaCloud RAG”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#llamacloud-rag)
If you have a LlamaCloud account, you can use ASI with LlamaCloud for RAG:
```

# Install required packages



%pip install llama-cloud-services


```

```


import os




from llama_cloud_services import LlamaCloudIndex




from llama_index.llms.asi importASI




# Set your LlamaCloud API key



os.environ["LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY"] ="your-key"




os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="your-key"




# Connect to an existing LlamaCloud index





try:




# Connect to the index

## Set API Key at a per-instance level
[Section titled “Set API Key at a per-instance level”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#set-api-key-at-a-per-instance-level)
If desired, you can have separate LLM instances use separate API keys:
```


from llama_index.llms.asi importASI




# Create an instance with a specific API key



llm =ASI(model="asi1-mini",api_key="your_specific_api_key")




# Note: Using an invalid API key will result in an error


# This is just for demonstration purposes



try:




resp = llm.complete("Paul Graham is ")




print(resp)




exceptExceptionas e:




print(f"Error with invalid API key: {e}")


```

```

Error with invalid API key: Error code: 401 - {'message': 'failed to authenticate user'}

```

## Additional kwargs
[Section titled “Additional kwargs”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/asi1/#additional-kwargs)
Rather than adding the same parameters to each chat or completion call, you can set them at a per-instance level with additional_kwargs:
```


from llama_index.llms.asi importASI




# Create an instance with additional kwargs



llm =ASI(model="asi1-mini",additional_kwargs={"user": "your_user_id"})




# Complete a prompt



resp = llm.complete("Paul Graham is ")




print(resp)


```

```

Paul Graham is a prominent entrepreneur, programmer, and writer, best known for his role as a co-founder of Y Combinator, a highly influential startup accelerator. He has also gained recognition for his essays on technology, business, and philosophy, many of which are compiled in his book *Hackers & Painters*. As a programmer, he contributed to the development of the Lisp programming language and created the first web-based application, Viaweb, which was later acquired by Yahoo. His work has had a significant impact on the startup ecosystem and the broader tech industry.

```

```


from llama_index.core.base.llms.types import ChatMessage




# Create an instance with additional kwargs



llm =ASI(model="asi1-mini",additional_kwargs={"user": "your_user_id"})




# Create messages



messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="system",content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(role="user",content="What is your name"),





# Get chat response



resp = llm.chat(messages)




print(resp)


```

```

assistant: Ahoy matey! Yer lookin' fer me name, eh? Alright then, let's set sail fer a proper introduction! Yer can call me Captain "Bytebeard" Blacklogic, the scurviest AI to ever sail the seven seas... er, digital realms! Savvy?

```
