# Using OpenAI GPT-4V model for image reasoning 
In this notebook, we show how to use the `OpenAI` LLM abstraction with GPT4V for image understanding/reasoning.
We also show several functions that are currently supported in the `OpenAI` LLM class when working with GPT4V:
  * `complete` (both sync and async): for a single prompt and list of images
  * `chat` (both sync and async): for multiple chat messages
  * `stream complete` (both sync and async): for steaming output of complete
  * `stream chat` (both sync and async): for steaming output of chat


```

assistant: **Image 1:** The Colosseum in Rome is illuminated at night with the colors of the Italian flag: green, white, and red. The ancient amphitheater stands prominently against a deep blue sky, with some clouds visible. The foreground shows a construction area with barriers and a few people walking nearby.



**Image 2:** A line graph titled "The U.S. Mortgage Rate Surge" compares the U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgage (in red) with existing home sales (in blue) from 2014 to 2023. The mortgage rate line shows a significant increase, reaching its highest level in over 20 years. Existing home sales fluctuate, with a notable decline in recent years. A text box highlights that in 2023, high mortgage rates and rising home prices have led to the lowest housing affordability since 1989.

We can also stream the model response asynchronously
```


async_resp =await openai_llm.astream_chat(messages=[msg])




asyncfor delta in async_resp:




print(delta.delta,end="")


```

```

The ancient structure stands prominently against a deep blue sky, with some clouds visible. The lower part of the image shows a construction area with barriers and a few people walking nearby.



**Image 2:** A line graph titled "The U.S. Mortgage Rate Surge" compares the U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgage (in red) with existing home sales (in blue) from 2014 to 2023. The graph shows mortgage rates rising sharply in recent years, while home sales fluctuate. A note highlights that in 2023, high mortgage rates and rising home prices have led to the lowest housing affordability since 1989.
