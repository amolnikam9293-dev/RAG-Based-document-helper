**The author grew up skipping a step in the evolution of computers, learning Italian, walking through Florence, painting people, working with technology companies, seeking signature styles at RISD, living in a rent-stabilized apartment, launching software, editing code (including Lisp expressions), writing essays, publishing them online, and receiving feedback from angry readers. He also experienced the exponential growth of commodity processors in the 1990s, which rolled up high-end, special-purpose hardware and software companies. He also learned how to make a little Italian go a long way by stringing together abstract concepts with a few simple verbs. He also experienced the tight coupling of money and coolness in the art world, and the fact that anything expensive comes to be seen as cool, and anything seen as cool will soon become equally expensive. He also experienced the challenge of launching software, as he had to recruit an initial set of users and make sure they had decent-looking stores before launching publicly. He also experienced the first instance of what is now a familiar experience, when he read the comments and found they were full of angry people. He also experienced the difference between putting something online and publishing it online. Finally, he wrote essays about topics he had stacked up, and wrote a more detailed version for others to read.**

**The author grew up during the Internet Bubble and was running a startup. They had to hire more people than they wanted to in order to seem more professional and were at the mercy of their investors until Yahoo bought them. They learned a lot about retail and startups, and had to do a lot of things that they weren’t necessarily good at in order to make their business successful.**
