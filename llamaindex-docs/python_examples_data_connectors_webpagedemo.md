# Using Spider Reader 🕷
[Section titled “Using Spider Reader 🕷”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/data_connectors/webpagedemo/#using-spider-reader)
[Spider](https://spider.cloud/?ref=llama_index) is the [fastest](https://github.com/spider-rs/spider/blob/main/benches/BENCHMARKS.md#benchmark-results) crawler. It converts any website into pure HTML, markdown, metadata or text while enabling you to crawl with custom actions using AI.
Spider allows you to use high performance proxies to prevent detection, caches AI actions, webhooks for crawling status, scheduled crawls etc…
**Prerequisites:** you need to have a Spider api key to use this loader. You can get one on [spider.cloud](https://spider.cloud).
```

Our API is predictable, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs. Set your API secret key in the `authorization` header to commence. You can use the `content-type` header with `application/json`, `application/xml`, `text/csv`, and `application/jsonl` for shaping the response.The Spider API supports multi domain actions. You can work with multiple domains per request by adding the urls comma separated.The Spider API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality. You can add `v1` before any path to pin to the version.Just getting started?----------Check out our [development quickstart](/guides/spider-api) guide.Not a developer?----------Use Spiders [no-code options or apps](/guides/spider) to get started with Spider and to do more with your Spider account no code required.Base UrlJSONCopy```https://api.spider.cloud```Crawl websites==========Start crawling a website(s) to collect resources.POST https://api.spider.cloud/crawlRequest body* url\xa0required\xa0string  ----------  The URI resource to crawl.

The challenges typically faced involve being able to get the data from a website without being blocked and setting up query selectors for the information you need using javascript. This would often break in two folds - the data extracting with a correct stealth technique or the css selector breaking as they update the website HTML code. Now we toss those two hard challenges away - one of them spider takes care of and the other the advancement in AI to process and extract information.UI (Extracting Contacts)----------You can use the UI on the dashboard to extract contacts after you crawled a page. Go to the page youwant to extract and click on the horizontal dropdown menu to display an option to extract the contact.The crawl will get the data first to see if anything new has changed. Afterwards if a contact was found usually within 10-60 seconds you will get a notification that the extraction is complete with the data.![Extracting contacts with the spider app](/img/app/extract-contacts.png)After extraction if the page has contact related data you can view it with a grid in the app.![The menu displaying the found contacts after extracting with the spider app](/img/app/extract-contacts-found.png)The grid will display the name, email, phone, title, and host(website found) of the contact(s).![Grid display of all the contact information found for the web page](/img/app/extract-contacts-grid.png)API Extracting Usage----------The endpoint `/pipeline/extract-contacts` provides the ability to extract all contacts from a website concurrently.### API Extracting Example ###To extract contacts from a website you can follow the example below. All params are optional except `url`. Use the `prompt` param to adjust the way the AI handles the extracting. If you use the param `store_data` or if the website already exist in the dashboard the contact data will be saved with the page.```import requests, os, jsonheaders = {    \'Authorization\': os.environ["SPIDER_API_KEY"],    \'Content-Type\': \'application/json\',}json_data = {"limit":1,"url":"http://www.example.com/contacts", "model": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "prompt": "A custom prompt to tailor the extracting."}response = requests.post(\'https://api.spider.cloud/crawl/pipeline/extract-contacts\',  headers=headers,  json=json_data,  stream=True)for line in response.iter_lines():  if line:      print(json.loads(line))```### Pipelines Combo ###Piplines bring a whole new entry to workflows for data curation, if you combine the API endpoints to only use the extraction on pages you know may have contacts can save credits on the system. One way would be to perform gathering all the links first with the `/links` endpoint. After getting the links for the pages use `/pipeline/filter-links` with a custom prompt that can use AI to reduce the noise of the links to process before `/pipline/extract-contacts`.Loading graph...Written on:  2/1/2024[API](/docs/api) [Pricing](/credits/new) [Guides](/guides) [About](/about) [Docs](https://docs.rs/spider/latest/spider/) [Privacy](/privacy) [Terms](/eula)© 2024 Spider from A11yWatchTheme Light Dark Toggle Theme [GitHubGithub](https://github.com/spider-rs/spider)', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), Document(id_='5e7ade0d-0a50-46de-8116-72ee5dca0b20', embedding=None, metadata={'description': 'How to use the Spider API to curate data from any source blazing fast.

We deliver consistent latency times ensuring swift processing for all responses.For an in-depth understanding of the request parameters supported, we invite you to explore our comprehensive API documentation. At present, we do not provide client-side libraries, as our API has been crafted with simplicity in mind for straightforward usage. However, we are open to expanding our offerings in the future to enhance user convenience.Dive into our [documentation]((/docs/api)) to get started and unleash the full potential of our web crawler today.API Usage----------Getting started with the API is simple and straight forward. After you get your [secret key](/api-keys)you can access our instance directly. We have one main endpoint `/crawl` that handles all things relatedto data curation. The crawler is highly configurable through the params to fit all needs.Crawling One Page----------Most cases you probally just want to crawl one page. Even if you only need one page, our system performs fast enough to lead the race.The most straight forward way to make sure you only crawl a single page is to set the [budget limit](./account/settings) with a wild card value or `*` to 1.You can also pass in the param `limit` in the JSON body with the limit of pages.Crawling Multiple Pages----------When you crawl multiple pages, the concurrency horsepower of the spider kicks in. You might wonder why and how one request may take (x)ms to come back, and 100 requests take about the same time! That’s because the built-in isolated concurrency allows for crawling thousands to millions of pages in no time. It’s the only current solution that can handle large websites with over 100k pages within a minute or two (sometimes even in a blink or two). By default, we do not add any limits to crawls unless specified.### Planet Scale Crawling ###If you plan on processing crawls that have over 200 pages, we recommend streaming the request from the client instead of parsing the entire payload once finished. We have an example of this with Python on the API docs page, also shown below.```import requests, os, jsonheaders = {    \'Authorization\': os.environ["SPIDER_API_KEY"],    \'Content-Type\': \'application/json\',}json_data = {"limit":250,"url":"http://www.example.com"}response = requests.post(\'https://api.spider.cloud/crawl/crawl\',  headers=headers,  json=json_data,  stream=True)for line in response.iter_lines():  if line:      print(json.loads(line))```#### Automatic Configuration ####Spider handles automatic concurrency handling and ip rotation to make it simple to curate data.The more credits you have or usage available allows for a higher concurrency limit.Written on:  1/3/2024[API](/docs/api) [Pricing](/credits/new) [Guides](/guides) [About](/about) [Docs](https://docs.rs/spider/latest/spider/) [Privacy](/privacy) [Terms](/eula)© 2024 Spider from A11yWatchTheme Light Dark Toggle Theme [GitHubGithub](https://github.com/spider-rs/spider)', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), Document(id_='08e5f1d6-4ae7-4b68-ab96-4b6a3768e88c', embedding=None, metadata={'description': 'The programmable time machine that can store pages and all assets for easy website archiving.', 'domain': 'spider.cloud', 'extracted_data': None, 'file_size': 18970, 'keywords': None, 'pathname': '/guides/website-archiving', 'resource_type': 'html', 'title': 'Guides - Website Archiving', 'url': '48f1bc3c-3fbb-408a-865b-c191a1bb1f48/spider.cloud/guides*_*website-archiving.html', 'user_id': '48f1bc3c-3fbb-408a-865b-c191a1bb1f48'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Guides - Website Archiving[Spider v1 Logo Spider ](/) [Credits](/credits/new)[GitHubGithub637](https://github.com/spider-rs/spider)Website Archiving==========With Spider you can easily backup or capture a website at any point in time.Enable Full Resource storing in the settings or website configuration to get a 1:1 copy of any websitelocally.Time Machine----------Time machine is storing data at a certain point of a time.

The first and simplest is to use the UI available for scraping.The alternative is to use the API to programmatically access the system and perform actions.### Crawling (Website) ###1. Register or login to your account using email or Github.2. Purchase [credits](/credits/new) to kickstart crawls with `pay-as-you-go` go after credits deplete.3. Configure crawl [settings](/account/settings) to fit workflows that you need.4. Navigate to the [dashboard](/) and enter a website url or ask a question to get a url that should be crawled.5. Crawl the website and export/download the data as needed.### Crawling (API) ###1. Register or login to your account using email or Github.2. Purchase [credits](/credits/new) to kickstart crawls with `pay-as-you-go` after credits deplete.3. Configure crawl [settings](/account/settings) to fit workflows that you need.4. Navigate to [API keys](/api-keys) and create a new secret key.5. Go to the [API docs](/docs/api) page to see how the API works and perform crawls with code examples.Crawl Configuration----------Configuration your account for how you would like to crawl can help save costs or effectiveness of the content. Some of the configurations include setting Premium Proxies, Headless Browser Rendering, Webhooks, and Budgeting.### Proxies ###Using proxies with our system is straight forward. Simple check the toggle on if you want all request to use a proxy to increase the success of not being blocked.![Proxies example app screenshot.](/img/app/proxy-setting.png)### Headless Browser ###If you want pages that require JavaScript to be executed the headless browser config is for you. Enabling will run all request through a real Chrome Browser for JavaScript required rendering pages.![Headless browser example app screenshot.](/img/app/headless-browser.png)### Crawl Budget Limits ###One of the key things you may need to do before getting into the crawl is setting up crawl-budgets.Crawl budgets allows you to determine how many pages you are going to crawl for a website.Determining the budget will save you costs when dealing with large websites that you only want certain data points from. The example below shows adding a asterisk (\\*) to determine all routes with a limit of 50 pages maximum. The settings can be overwritten by the website configuration or parameters if using the API.![Crawl budget example screenshot](/img/app/edit-budget.png)Crawling and Scraping Websites----------Collecting data can be done in many ways and for many reasons. Leveraging our state-of-the-art technology allows you to create fast workloads that can process content from multiple locations. At the time of writing, we have started to focus on our data processing API instead of the dashboard. The API has much more flexibility than the UI for performing advanced workloads like batching, formatting, and so on.![Dashboard UI for Spider displaying data collecting from www.napster.com, jeffmendez.com, rsseau.rs, and www.drake.com](/img/app/ui-crawl.png)### Transforming Data ###The API has more features for gathering the content in different formats and transforming the HTML as needed. You can transform the content from HTML to Markdown and feed it to a LLM for better handling the learning aspect. The API is the first class citizen for the application. The UI will have the features provided by the API eventually as the need arises.#### Leveraging Open Source ####One of the reasons Spider is the ultimate data-curation service for scraping is from the power of Open-Source. The core of the engine is completly available on [Github](https://github.com/spider-rs/spider) under [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) to show what is in store. We are constantly working on the crawler features including performance with plans to maintain the project for the long run.Subscription and Spider Credits----------The platform allows purchasing credits that gives you the ability to crawl at any time.When you purchase credits a crawl subscription is created that allows you to continue to usethe platform when your credits deplete. The limits provided coralate with the amount of creditspurchased, an example would be if you bought $5 in credits you would have about $40 in spending limit - $10 in credit gives $80 and so on.The highest purchase of credits directly determines how much is allowed on the platform. You can view your usage and credits on the [usage limits page](/account/usage).Written on:  1/2/2024[API](/docs/api) [Pricing](/credits/new) [Guides](/guides) [About](/about) [Docs](https://docs.rs/spider/latest/spider/) [Privacy](/privacy) [Terms](/eula)© 2024 Spider from A11yWatchTheme Light Dark Toggle Theme [GitHubGithub](https://github.com/spider-rs/spider)', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n'), Document(id_='44bff527-c7f3-4346-a2f8-1454c52e1b01', embedding=None, metadata={'description': 'Generate API keys that allow access to the system programmatically anywhere.

# Using Scrapy Web Reader 🕸️
[Section titled “Using Scrapy Web Reader 🕸️”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/data_connectors/webpagedemo/#using-scrapy-web-reader-%EF%B8%8F)
Scrapy is a popular web crawling framework for Python. The ScrapyWebReader allows you to leverage Scrapy’s powerful crawling capabilities to extract data from websites. It can be used in 2 ways
  1. By providing an Scrapy spider class.
  2. By providing the path to a Scrapy project.


### 1. Using with Scrapy Spider Class
[Section titled “1. Using with Scrapy Spider Class”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/data_connectors/webpagedemo/#1-using-with-scrapy-spider-class)
```


from scrapy.spiders import Spider




from llama_index.readers.web import ScrapyWebReader






classSampleSpider(Spider):




name ="sample_spider"




start_urls =["http://quotes.toscrape.com"]





defparse(self, response):







reader =ScrapyWebReader()




docs = reader.load_data(SampleSpider)


```

### 2. Using with Scrapy Project Path
[Section titled “2. Using with Scrapy Project Path”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/data_connectors/webpagedemo/#2-using-with-scrapy-project-path)
Downloading a Sample Scrapy Project
```


%git clone https://github.com/scrapy/quotesbot.git


```

Using the scrapy project with spider named “toscrape-css”
```


from llama_index.readers.web import ScrapyWebReader





reader =ScrapyWebReader(project_path="./quotesbot")




docs = reader.load_data("toscrape-css")


```

### Metadata
[Section titled “Metadata”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/data_connectors/webpagedemo/#metadata)
Some keys from the scraped items can be stored as metadata in the Document object. You can specify which keys to include as metadata using the `metadata_keys` parameter. If you want to keep the keys in both the content and as metadata, you can set the `keep_keys` parameter to `True`.
```


reader =ScrapyWebReader(




project_path="./quotesbot",




metadata_keys=["author", "tags"],




keep_keys=True,





docs = reader.load_data("toscrape-css")


```
