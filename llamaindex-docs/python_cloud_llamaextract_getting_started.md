# Getting Started
## Overview
[Section titled “Overview”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/cloud/llamaextract/getting_started/#overview)
LlamaExtract provides a simple API for extracting structured data from unstructured documents like PDFs, text files, and images.
LlamaExtract is available as a web UI, Python SDK and REST API.

[Section titled “Is LlamaExtract right for me?”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/cloud/llamaextract/getting_started/#is-llamaextract-right-for-me)
LlamaExtract is a great fit for when you need:
  * **Well-typed data for downstream tasks** : You want to extract data from documents and use it for downstream tasks like training a model, building a dashboard, entering into a database, etc. LlamaExtract guarantees that your data complies with the provided schema or provides helpful error messages when it doesn’t.
  * **Accurate data extraction** : We use the best in class LLM models to extract data from your documents.
  * **Iterative schema development** : You want to quickly iterate on your schema and get feedback on how well it works on your sample documents. Do you need to provide more examples to extract a certain field? Do you need to make a certain field optional?
  * **Support for multiple file types** : LlamaExtract supports a wide range of file types, including PDFs, text files, and images. Let us know if you need support for another file type!


## Quick Start

### Using the web UI
[Section titled “Using the web UI”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/cloud/llamaextract/getting_started/#using-the-web-ui)
The simplest way to try out LlamaExtract is to [use the web UI](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/cloud/llamaextract/getting_started/web_ui).
Just define your Extraction Agent (schema and settings), drag and drop any supported document into LlamaCloud and extract data from your documents.
### Get an API key
[Section titled “Get an API key”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/cloud/llamaextract/getting_started/#get-an-api-key)
Once you’re ready to start coding, [get an API key](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/cloud/general/api_key) to use LlamaExtract with the Python SDK.
### Use our libraries
[Section titled “Use our libraries”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/cloud/llamaextract/getting_started/#use-our-libraries)
We have a library available for Python. This is the recommended way to use LlamaExtract for running extraction jobs at scale. Check out the [Python quick start](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/cloud/llamaextract/getting_started/python) to get started.
### REST API
[Section titled “REST API”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/cloud/llamaextract/getting_started/#rest-api)
If you are using a language other than Python, you can use the [REST API](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/cloud/llamaextract/getting_started/api).
