# Vector Stores
Vector stores contain embedding vectors of ingested document chunks (and sometimes the document chunks as well).
## Simple Vector Store
[Section titled “Simple Vector Store”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/storing/vector_stores/#simple-vector-store)
By default, LlamaIndex uses a simple in-memory vector store that’s great for quick experimentation. They can be persisted to (and loaded from) disk by calling `vector_store.persist()` (and `SimpleVectorStore.from_persist_path(...)` respectively).
## Vector Store Options & Feature Support
[Section titled “Vector Store Options & Feature Support”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/storing/vector_stores/#vector-store-options--feature-support)
LlamaIndex supports over 20 different vector store options. We are actively adding more integrations and improving feature coverage for each.
