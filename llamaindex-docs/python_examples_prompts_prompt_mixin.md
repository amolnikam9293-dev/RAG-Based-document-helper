# Accessing/Customizing Prompts within Higher-Level Modules 
LlamaIndex contains a variety of higher-level modules (query engines, response synthesizers, retrievers, etc.), many of which make LLM calls + use prompt templates.
This guide shows how you can 1) access the set of prompts for any module (including nested) with `get_prompts`, and 2) update these prompts easily with `update_prompts`.
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
```


%pip install llama-index


```

```


import os





os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="sk-..."


```

```


from llama_index.core import Settings




from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI




from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding




# Set the default embedding model and LLM



Settings.embed_model =OpenAIEmbedding(model_name="text-embedding-3-small")




Settings.llm =OpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")


```

## Setup: Load Data, Build Index, and Get Query Engine
[Section titled “Setup: Load Data, Build Index, and Get Query Engine”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/prompts/prompt_mixin/#setup-load-data-build-index-and-get-query-engine)
Here we build a vector index over a toy dataset (PG’s essay), and access the query engine.
The query engine is a simple RAG pipeline consisting of top-k retrieval + LLM synthesis.
Download Data
```


!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'




!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'-O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'


```

```


from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader




# load documents



documents =SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham/").load_data()


```

```


from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex





index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)


```

```


query_engine = index.as_query_engine(response_mode="tree_summarize")


```

```


from IPython.display import Markdown, display





# define prompt viewing function



defdisplay_prompt_dict(prompts_dict):




for k, p in prompts_dict.items():

display(Markdown(text_md))




print(p.get_template())




display(Markdown("<br><br>"))


```

## Accessing Prompts
[Section titled “Accessing Prompts”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/prompts/prompt_mixin/#accessing-prompts)
Here we get the prompts from the query engine. Note that _all_ prompts are returned, including ones used in sub-modules in the query engine. This allows you to centralize a view of these prompts!
```


prompts_dict = query_engine.get_prompts()


```

```


display_prompt_dict(prompts_dict)


```

**Prompt Key** : response_synthesizer:summary_template**Text:**
```

Context information from multiple sources is below.

[Section titled “Checking get_prompts on Response Synthesizer”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/prompts/prompt_mixin/#checking-get_prompts-on-response-synthesizer)
You can also call `get_prompts` on the underlying response synthesizer, where you’ll see the same list.
```


prompts_dict = query_engine.response_synthesizer.get_prompts()




display_prompt_dict(prompts_dict)


```

[Section titled “Checking get_prompts with a different response synthesis strategy”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/prompts/prompt_mixin/#checking-get_prompts-with-a-different-response-synthesis-strategy)
Here we try the default `compact` method.
We’ll see that the set of templates used are different; a QA template and a refine template.
```

# set Logging to DEBUG for more detailed outputs



query_engine = index.as_query_engine(response_mode="compact")


```

```


prompts_dict = query_engine.get_prompts()




display_prompt_dict(prompts_dict)

#### Put into query engine, get response
[Section titled “Put into query engine, get response”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/prompts/prompt_mixin/#put-into-query-engine-get-response)
```


response = query_engine.query("What did the author do growing up?")




print(str(response))


```

```

The author worked on writing and programming outside of school before college. They wrote short stories and tried writing programs on an IBM 1401 computer using an early version of Fortran. They later got a microcomputer and started programming on it, writing simple games and a word processor. They also mentioned their interest in philosophy and AI.

```

## Customize the prompt
[Section titled “Customize the prompt”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/prompts/prompt_mixin/#customize-the-prompt)
You can also update/customize the prompts with the `update_prompts` function. Pass in arg values with the keys equal to the keys you see in the prompt dictionary.
Here we’ll change the summary prompt to use Shakespeare.
```


from llama_index.core import PromptTemplate




# reset



query_engine = index.as_query_engine(response_mode="tree_summarize")




# shakespeare!



new_summary_tmpl_str = (




"Context information is below.\n"




"---------------------\n"




"{context_str}\n"




"---------------------\n"




"Given the context information and not prior knowledge, "




"answer the query in the style of a Shakespeare play.\n"




"Query: {query_str}\n"




"Answer: "





new_summary_tmpl =PromptTemplate(new_summary_tmpl_str)


```

```


query_engine.update_prompts(




{"response_synthesizer:summary_template": new_summary_tmpl}



```

```


prompts_dict = query_engine.get_prompts()


```

```


display_prompt_dict(prompts_dict)

## Accessing Prompts from Other Modules
[Section titled “Accessing Prompts from Other Modules”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/prompts/prompt_mixin/#accessing-prompts-from-other-modules)
Here we take a look at some other modules: query engines, routers/selectors, evaluators, and others.
```


from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import ReActAgent




from llama_index.core.selectors import LLMMultiSelector




from llama_index.core.evaluation import FaithfulnessEvaluator, DatasetGenerator




from llama_index.core.postprocessor import LLMRerank

You are designed to help with a variety of tasks, from answering questions to providing summaries to other types of analyses.



## Tools



You have access to a wide variety of tools. You are responsible for using the tools in any sequence you deem appropriate to complete the task at hand.


This may require breaking the task into subtasks and using different tools to complete each subtask.



You have access to the following tools:


{tool_desc}




## Output Format



Please answer in the same language as the question and use the following format:



```


Thought: The current language of the user is: (user's language). I need to use a tool to help me answer the question.


Action: tool name (one of {tool_names}) if using a tool.


Action Input: the input to the tool, in a JSON format representing the kwargs (e.g. {{"input": "hello world", "num_beams": 5}})


```



Please ALWAYS start with a Thought.



NEVER surround your response with markdown code markers. You may use code markers within your response if you need to.



Please use a valid JSON format for the Action Input. Do NOT do this {{'input': 'hello world', 'num_beams': 5}}.



If this format is used, the tool will respond in the following format:



```


Observation: tool response


```



You should keep repeating the above format till you have enough information to answer the question without using any more tools. At that point, you MUST respond in one of the following two formats:



```


Thought: I can answer without using any more tools. I'll use the user's language to answer


Answer: [your answer here (In the same language as the user's question)]


```



```


Thought: I cannot answer the question with the provided tools.


Answer: [your answer here (In the same language as the user's question)]


```

Skill 1. Use the Search API to look up relevant information by writing     "[Search(query)]" where "query" is the search query you want to look up.     For example:



Query: But what are the risks during production of nanomaterials?


Answer: [Search(What are some nanomaterial production risks?)]



Query: The colors on the flag of Ghana have the following meanings.


Answer: Red is for [Search(What is the meaning of Ghana's flag being red?)],     green for forests, and gold for mineral wealth.



Query: What did the author do during his time in college?


Answer: The author took classes in [Search(What classes did the author take in     college?)].





Skill 2. Solve more complex generation tasks by thinking step by step. For example:



Query: Give a summary of the author's life and career.


Answer: The author was born in 1990. Growing up, he [Search(What did the     author do during his childhood?)].



Query: Can you write a summary of the Great Gatsby.


Answer: The Great Gatsby is a novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is about     [Search(What is the Great Gatsby about?)].




Now given the following task, and the stub of an existing answer, generate the next portion of the answer. You may use the Search API "[Search(query)]" whenever possible.


If the answer is complete and no longer contains any "[Search(query)]" tags, write     "done" to finish the task.


Do not write "done" if the answer still contains "[Search(query)]" tags.


Do not make up answers. It is better to generate one "[Search(query)]" tag and stop generation


than to fill in the answer with made up information with no "[Search(query)]" tags


or multiple "[Search(query)]" tags that assume a structure in the answer.


Try to limit generation to one sentence if possible.

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query in the style of a Shakespeare play.


Query: {query_str}


Answer:

```

**Prompt Key** : lookahead_answer_inserter:answer_insert_prompt**Text:**
```

An existing 'lookahead response' is given below. The lookahead response


contains `[Search(query)]` tags. Some queries have been executed and the


response retrieved. The queries and answers are also given below.


Also the previous response (the response before the lookahead response)


is given below.


Given the lookahead template, previous response, and also queries and answers,


please 'fill in' the lookahead template with the appropriate answers.



NOTE: Please make sure that the final response grammatically follows


the previous response + lookahead template. For example, if the previous


response is "New York City has a population of " and the lookahead


template is "[Search(What is the population of New York City?)]", then


the final response should be "8.4 million".



NOTE: the lookahead template may not be a complete sentence and may


contain trailing/leading commas, etc. Please preserve the original


formatting of the lookahead template if possible.



NOTE:



NOTE: the exception to the above rule is if the answer to a query


is equivalent to "I don't know" or "I don't have an answer". In this case,


modify the lookahead template to indicate that the answer is not known.



NOTE: the lookahead template may contain multiple `[Search(query)]` tags



and only a subset of these queries have been executed.




Do not replace the `[Search(query)]` tags that have not been executed.
