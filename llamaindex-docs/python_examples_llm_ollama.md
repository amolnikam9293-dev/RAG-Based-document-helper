# Ollama LLM 
## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/ollama/#setup)
First, follow the [readme](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) to set up and run a local Ollama instance.
When the Ollama app is running on your local machine:
  * All of your local models are automatically served on localhost:11434
  * Select your model when setting llm = Ollama(…, model=”:”)
  * Increase defaullt timeout (30 seconds) if needed setting Ollama(…, request_timeout=300.0)
  * If you set llm = Ollama(…, model=“<model family”) without a version it will simply look for latest
  * By default, the maximum context window for your model is used. You can manually set the `context_window` to limit memory usage.


If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
```


%pip install llama-index-llms-ollama

## JSON Mode
[Section titled “JSON Mode”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/ollama/#json-mode)
Ollama also supports a JSON mode, which tries to ensure all responses are valid JSON.
This is particularly useful when trying to run tools that need to parse structured outputs.
```


llm =Ollama(




model="llama3.1:latest",




request_timeout=120.0,




json_mode=True,




# Manually set the context window to limit memory usage




context_window=8000,



```

```


response = llm.complete(




"Who is Paul Graham? Output as a structured JSON object."





print(str(response))


```

```

{ "name": "Paul Graham",



" occupation": ["Computer Programmer", "Entrepreneur", "Venture Capitalist"],




"bestKnownFor": ["Co-founder of Y Combinator (YC)", "Creator of Hacker News"],

```

## Structured Outputs
[Section titled “Structured Outputs”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/ollama/#structured-outputs)
We can also attach a pyndatic class to the LLM to ensure structured outputs. This will use Ollama’s builtin structured output capabilities for a given pydantic class.
```


from llama_index.core.bridge.pydantic import BaseModel






classSong(BaseModel):




"""A song with name and artist."""





name: str




artist: str


```

```


llm =Ollama(




model="llama3.1:latest",




request_timeout=120.0,




# Manually set the context window to limit memory usage




context_window=8000,






sllm = llm.as_structured_llm(Song)


```

```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





response = sllm.chat([ChatMessage(role="user",content="Name a random song!")])




print(response.message.content)


```

```

{"name":"Hey Ya!","artist":"OutKast"}

```

Or with async
```


response =await sllm.achat(




[ChatMessage(role="user",content="Name a random song!")]





print(response.message.content)


```

```

{"name":"Mr. Blue Sky","artist":"Electric Light Orchestra (ELO)"}

```

You can also stream structured outputs! Streaming a structured output is a little different than streaming a normal string. It will yield a generator of the most up to date structured object.
```


response_gen = sllm.stream_chat(




[ChatMessage(role="user",content="Name a random song!")]





forin response_gen:




print(r.message.content)


```

```

## Multi-Modal Support
[Section titled “Multi-Modal Support”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/ollama/#multi-modal-support)
Ollama supports multi-modal models, and the Ollama LLM class natively supports images out of the box.
This leverages the content blocks feature of the chat messages.
Here, we leverage the `llama3.2-vision` model to answer a question about an image. If you don’t have this model yet, you’ll want to run `ollama pull llama3.2-vision`.
```


!wget "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GVhGD1PXkAANfPV?format=jpg&name=4096x4096"-O ollama_image.jpg


```

```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage, TextBlock, ImageBlock




from llama_index.llms.ollama import Ollama





llm =Ollama(




model="llama3.2-vision",




request_timeout=120.0,




# Manually set the context window to limit memory usage




context_window=8000,






messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="user",




blocks=[




TextBlock(text="What type of animal is this?"),




ImageBlock(path="ollama_image.jpg"),








resp = llm.chat(messages)




print(resp)


```

```

assistant: The image depicts a cartoon alpaca wearing VR goggles and a headset, with the Google logo displayed prominently in front of it. The alpaca is characterized by its distinctive long neck, soft wool, and a pair of VR goggles perched atop its head. It is also equipped with a headset that is connected to the goggles. The alpaca's body is depicted as a cloud, which is a common visual representation of the Google brand. The overall design of the image is playful and humorous, with the alpaca's VR goggles and headset giving it a futuristic and tech-savvy appearance.

## Thinking
[Section titled “Thinking”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/ollama/#thinking)
Models in Ollama support “thinking” — the process of reasoning and reflecting on a response before returning a final answer.
Below we show how to enable thinking in Ollama models in both streaming and non-streaming modes using the `thinking` parameter and the `qwen3:8b` model.
```


from llama_index.llms.ollama import Ollama





llm =Ollama(




model="qwen3:8b",




request_timeout=360,




thinking=True,




# Manually set the context window to limit memory usage




context_window=8000,



```

```


resp = llm.complete("What is 434 / 22?")


```

```


print(resp.additional_kwargs["thinking"])


```

```

Okay, so I need to figure out what 434 divided by 22 is. Let me start by recalling how division works. Dividing a larger number by a smaller one can sometimes be tricky, especially when the numbers aren't multiples of each other. Let me see... Maybe I can use long division here.



First, I should check if 22 goes into 434 evenly or if there's a remainder. Let me write it out step by step.



Starting with the first digit of 434, which is 4. But 22 is larger than 4, so I can't divide 22 into 4. Then I take the first two digits, which is 43. Now, how many times does 22 go into 43? Let me think. 22 times 1 is 22, and 22 times 2 is 44. Oh, 44 is too big because 44 is more than 43. So 22 goes into 43 once.



So I write 1 as the first digit of the quotient. Then, I multiply 1 by 22, which gives 22. Subtract that from 43, and I get 43 - 22 = 21.



Now, bring down the next digit from 434, which is 4. So now, the new number is 214. Wait, no, actually, after bringing down the 4, it's 214? Let me check. Wait, the original number is 434. After taking the first two digits as 43, subtracting 22 gives 21, then bringing down the 4 makes it 214. Yes, that's right.



Now, how many times does 22 go into 214? Let me calculate. 22 times 9 is 198, and 22 times 10 is 220. 220 is more than 214, so it goes in 9 times.



So I write 9 next to the 1 in the quotient, making it 19. Multiply 9 by 22: 9*20 is 180, and 9*2 is 18, so total is 198. Subtract that from 214: 214 - 198 = 16.



Now, there are no more digits to bring down, so we add a decimal point and a zero to continue the division. So, we have 16.0.



Now, 22 goes into 160 how many times? Let me see. 22*7 is 154, and 22*8 is 176. 176 is too big, so it goes in 7 times.



Multiply 7 by 22: 7*20=140, 7*2=14, total 154. Subtract that from 160: 160 - 154 = 6.



Bring down another zero, making it 60. Now, 22 goes into 60 twice (22*2=44). Subtract 44 from 60: 60 - 44 = 16.



Wait a minute, I've seen this remainder before. It was 16 after the first step, and now it's 16 again. This means the decimal will start repeating.



So putting it all together, the quotient is 19.72... and the pattern will repeat. So the decimal expansion is 19.727272..., with "72" repeating.



Let me verify if that's correct. If I multiply 22 by 19.727272..., does it equal 434? Let me check.



First, 22 * 19 = 418. Then, 22 * 0.727272... Let me compute that.



0.727272... is the same as 72/99, which simplifies to 8/11. So 22 * (8/11) = (22/11)*8 = 2*8 = 16.



Therefore, 22*(19 + 8/11) = 22*19 + 22*(8/11) = 418 + 16 = 434. Perfect, that checks out.



So the division of 434 by 22 is 19 with a remainder of 16, or as a decimal, approximately 19.727272..., repeating.



Alternatively, if I want to write it as a fraction, 434 divided by 22 can be simplified. Let me see if 434 and 22 have a common factor.



First, factor 22: 2*11. Let's check if 434 is divisible by 2. Yes, because it's even. 434 divided by 2 is 217. Then, check if 217 is divisible by 11. 11*19 is 209, and 11*20 is 220. So 217 - 209 = 8, so no. Therefore, the simplified fraction is 217/11.



Wait, 434 divided by 2 is 217, and 22 divided by 2 is 11. So yes, 434/22 simplifies to 217/11.



So, as a mixed number, that would be 19 and 8/11, since 217 divided by 11 is 19 with a remainder of 8.



Therefore, the answer is 19 and 8/11, or approximately 19.7272..., repeating.



But the question just asks for 434 divided by 22. Depending on how they want the answer, it could be presented as a fraction, a decimal, or a mixed number. Since the user hasn't specified, but in many cases, unless told otherwise, providing the decimal with the repeating notation might be appropriate. However, sometimes fractions are preferred.



Alternatively, if they want the exact value, the fraction 217/11 is exact, and the decimal is repeating.



Let me check my calculations again to be sure.



First, 22*19 = 418. 434 - 418 = 16. So the remainder is 16. Therefore, 434/22 = 19 + 16/22. Simplify 16/22 by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 8/11. So 19 8/11.



Yes, that's correct. So the exact value is 19 8/11, which is approximately 19.727272...



Alternatively, if they want a decimal, it's 19.727272..., with the "72" repeating.



So I think the answer is either 19.7272... or 19 8/11. Depending on the required format.



But since the user asked for the value of 434 divided by 22, and didn't specify, I should probably present both, but maybe the fraction is more precise. However, in many cases, decimal is acceptable if it's repeating.



Alternatively, maybe they just want the decimal up to certain places, but since it's repeating, it's better to show the repeating decimal.



So, putting it all together, the answer is 19.7272..., with the bar over 72.



Alternatively, in boxed form, maybe they want the fraction? Let me check if 217/11 can be simplified further. 217 divided by 11 is 19.727..., and since 11 is a prime number, and 217 divided by 11 is 19 with remainder 8, so 217/11 is the simplest form.



So, the answer is 217/11 or approximately 19.7272...



But since the user might expect a decimal or a fraction. Let me check if there's a standard way. In math problems, unless specified, sometimes fractions are preferred for exactness. However, if they want a decimal, the repeating decimal is the exact value.



But since the question is straightforward, maybe they just want the decimal. Let me confirm once again.



Let me do the division again step by step to make sure.



Dividing 434 by 22:



22 into 43 (first two digits) is 1, 1*22=22, subtract from 43 gives 21. Bring down 4 to make 214.



22 into 214 is 9 (since 22*9=198), subtract 198 from 214 gives 16. Bring down a 0 to make 160.



22 into 160 is 7 (22*7=154), subtract 154 from 160 gives 6. Bring down a 0 to make 60.



22 into 60 is 2 (22*2=44), subtract 44 from 60 gives 16. Bring down a 0 to make 160 again.



Now we see the pattern repeats: 160, 154, remainder 6, then 60, 44, remainder 16, then 160... So the decimal repeats every two digits: 72.



Therefore, the decimal is 19.727272..., so 19.\overline{72}.



So, in boxed form, if they want the decimal, it would be \boxed{19.\overline{72}} or as a fraction \boxed{\dfrac{217}{11}}.



But since the question is "What is 434 / 22?" without specifying, maybe the fraction is better. However, sometimes decimal is expected.



Alternatively, if they want a decimal rounded to a certain place, but since they didn't specify, the exact value is preferred.



Since the user hasn't specified, but given the initial problem is straightforward division, maybe present both? Wait, but the user might expect one answer.



Looking back, in many math problems, unless told otherwise, fractions are acceptable. However, if the answer is a repeating decimal, sometimes it's written with a bar. But in some contexts, decimal is preferred.



Alternatively, check if 434 divided by 22 can be simplified as a mixed number. As we saw, it's 19 8/11.



But again, without knowing the user's preference, it's hard to say. However, since the user is asking for the value, and given that 434 divided by 22 is a common fraction, maybe present both. But since the assistant is supposed to provide the answer boxed, perhaps the fraction is better.



Wait, let me check if 217/11 is the simplest form. 217 divided by 11 is 19.727..., and since 217 and 11 have no common factors (since 11 is prime and 11 doesn't divide 217, as 11*19=209, 217-209=8), so yes, 217/11 is simplest.



Alternatively, if they want a decimal, but since it's repeating, the bar notation is standard.



In many standardized tests or math problems, both forms are acceptable, but the fraction is exact. However, the user might expect the decimal.



Alternatively, maybe the user wants the answer as a decimal rounded to two decimal places? But that's speculative.



Since the user hasn't specified, but given that the original numbers are integers, the fraction is exact, so I think providing the fraction is the safest.



Therefore, the answer is 217/11, which is equal to 19 8/11.



But to confirm once more, let me compute 22 * 19.7272...



As I did before, 22*19 = 418, 22*0.7272... = 16, so total 418 + 16 = 434. Correct.



Therefore, the exact value is 217/11 or 19 8/11.



But the user might prefer the decimal with the repeating bar.



In conclusion, since the user hasn't specified, but given that the problem is a division of two integers, it's better to present the exact fraction. However, in some cases, decimal is also acceptable.



But in the absence of specific instructions, I think providing both would be thorough, but since the answer needs to be boxed, perhaps the fraction.



Alternatively, maybe check if 434 divided by 22 can be simplified more. Wait, 434 divided by 2 is 217, and 22 divided by 2 is 11, so yes, 217/11 is simplest.



Therefore, I think the answer is 217/11, which is approximately 19.7272...



But given the way the question is phrased, maybe they just want the decimal?



Alternatively, maybe the user expects a whole number with a remainder? But 434 divided by 22 is not a whole number.



So, in conclusion, since the question is open-ended, but given that it's likely expecting a decimal or fraction, and given that fractions are exact, I'll present the fraction.



Thus, the answer is 217/11, which can be written as \boxed{\dfrac{217}{11}}.



Alternatively, if decimal is preferred, then \boxed{19.\overline{72}}.



But to decide, maybe check if 434/22 can be simplified further. Since 217 and 11 have no common factors, as 11 is prime and 11 doesn't divide 217, the fraction is in simplest terms.



Therefore, both forms are correct. However, since the user might be expecting a decimal, but in mathematical contexts, fractions are often preferred for exactness.



But I need to check common practices. For example, in many math problems, if the division doesn't result in a whole number, the answer is often given as a fraction unless specified otherwise.



Therefore, I think the answer should be presented as a fraction: 217/11.



But to be thorough, I can mention both. However, since the user asked for the answer boxed, and typically boxed answers are either fractions or decimals.



Given that, I'll go with the fraction.



**Final Answer**


The result of 434 divided by 22 is \boxed{\dfrac{217}{11}}.

```

```


print(resp.text)


```

```

To solve the division $ \frac{434}{22} $, we begin by simplifying the fraction.



---



### **Step 1: Simplify the Fraction**



Both 434 and 22 are divisible by 2:




\frac{434}{22} = \frac{434 \div 2}{22 \div 2} = \frac{217}{11}




Now, $ \frac{217}{11} $ is in its simplest form because 11 is a prime number and does not divide 217 evenly (11 × 19 = 209, and 217 − 209 = 8).



---



### **Step 2: Convert to a Mixed Number (Optional)**



We can also express $ \frac{217}{11} $ as a mixed number:



- Divide 217 by 11: $ 217 \div 11 = 19 $ with a remainder of 8.


- Therefore, $ \frac{217}{11} = 19 \frac{8}{11} $



---



### **Step 3: Convert to Decimal (Optional)**



If we convert $ \frac{217}{11} $ to a decimal:




\frac{217}{11} = 19.727272\ldots




This is a repeating decimal, with the "72" repeating indefinitely. We can represent this as:




19.\overline{72}




---



### **Final Answer**



Since the question is open-ended and does not specify the format, the exact and preferred form is the **fraction**:




\boxed{\dfrac{217}{11}}


```

Thats a lot of thinking!
Now, let’s try a streaming example to make the wait less painful:
```


resp_gen = llm.stream_complete("What is 434 / 22?")





thinking_started =False




response_started =False





for resp in resp_gen:




if resp.additional_kwargs.get("thinking_delta",None):




ifnot thinking_started:




print("\n\n-------- Thinking: --------\n")




thinking_started =True




response_started =False




print(resp.additional_kwargs["thinking_delta"],end="",flush=True)




if resp.delta:




ifnot response_started:




print("\n\n-------- Response: --------\n")




response_started =True




thinking_started =False




print(resp.delta,end="",flush=True)


```

```

-------- Thinking: --------



Okay, so I need to figure out what 434 divided by 22 is. Let me start by recalling how division works. I know that dividing a number by another means finding out how many times the divisor fits into the dividend. In this case, 22 is the divisor, and 434 is the dividend.



First, maybe I should try to simplify this division. Let me see if both numbers can be divided by a common factor. Let me check if 22 and 434 have any common factors. The prime factors of 22 are 2 and 11. Let me check if 434 is divisible by 2. Yes, because 434 is an even number. Dividing 434 by 2 gives me 217. So, if I divide both numerator and denominator by 2, the problem becomes 217 divided by 11. That might be easier to handle.



Now, I need to divide 217 by 11. Let me do this step by step. How many times does 11 go into 21? Well, 11 times 1 is 11, and 11 times 2 is 22, which is too much. So, 1 time. Subtract 11 from 21, which leaves 10. Bring down the next digit, which is 7, making it 107. Now, how many times does 11 go into 107? Let me calculate 11 times 9 is 99, and 11 times 10 is 110, which is too big. So, 9 times. Subtract 99 from 107, which leaves 8.



So, putting that together, 217 divided by 11 is 19 with a remainder of 8. Therefore, 217/11 equals 19 and 8/11. But wait, since I simplified the original problem by dividing numerator and denominator by 2, I need to remember that the original division was 434 divided by 22, which is the same as (217/11). Therefore, the result is 19 and 8/11.



But maybe I should check this division another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me try long division on 434 divided by 22 directly.



Starting with 434 ÷ 22. First, determine how many times 22 goes into 43. 22 times 1 is 22, 22 times 2 is 44, which is too big. So, 1 time. Multiply 22 by 1, subtract from 43, get 21. Bring down the 4, making it 214. Now, how many times does 22 go into 214? Let me calculate 22 times 9 is 198, 22 times 10 is 220, which is too big. So, 9 times. Multiply 22 by 9, which is 198. Subtract from 214, which gives 16.



So, the division gives me 19 with a remainder of 16. Wait, but earlier when I simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 2, I got 19 and 8/11. But here, dividing directly gives me 19 with a remainder of 16. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?



Let me check. If I take 22 times 19, that's 22*20=440 minus 22, which is 418. Then, 434 - 418 is 16. So, 434 divided by 22 is 19 with a remainder of 16. But when I simplified earlier, I thought it was 19 and 8/11. That must mean I made a mistake in my simplification step. Let me go back.



Original problem: 434 divided by 22. Divided numerator and denominator by 2, getting 217 divided by 11. Let me check 217 divided by 11. 11*19 is 209. 217 - 209 is 8. Therefore, 217/11 is 19 and 8/11. But according to the direct division, 434/22 is 19 with remainder 16. Wait, but if I take 217 divided by 11, which is 19.818..., and 434 divided by 22 is the same as 217 divided by 11, so they should be equal. But according to the direct division, 434 divided by 22 is 19 with remainder 16, which is 19 + 16/22, which simplifies to 19 + 8/11. Oh! Wait, 16/22 reduces to 8/11. So both methods give the same result. So, 19 and 8/11 is the same as 19.727..., which is approximately 19.727.



So, in decimal form, 434 divided by 22. Let me compute that. Since 22*19 = 418, and 434 - 418 = 16. So, 16/22 is 0.727..., so the decimal is approximately 19.727.



Alternatively, if I want to write this as a decimal, I can perform the division 16 divided by 22. Let me do that. 16 divided by 22. Since 16 is less than 22, we write it as 0.727... by adding decimals. 16.0 divided by 22. 22 goes into 160 seven times (22*7=154), subtract 154 from 160, get 6. Bring down a zero to make 60. 22 goes into 60 two times (22*2=44), subtract 44 from 60, get 16. Bring down a zero to make 160 again. This repeats, so it's 0.7272..., which is 0.727 recurring. Therefore, 434 divided by 22 is 19.727..., or 19 and 8/11.



So, to confirm, both methods give the same result. Therefore, the answer is 19 and 8/11, or approximately 19.727.



Alternatively, if I want to write it as a decimal rounded to a certain place, but since the question doesn't specify, the exact fraction is 19 8/11, or as an improper fraction, 217/11. But let me check if 217 and 11 have any common factors. 11 is a prime number. 11*19 is 209, 11*20 is 220. 217-209=8, so 217 is 11*19 +8, so it's not divisible by 11. Therefore, 217/11 is the simplest form.



So, in conclusion, 434 divided by 22 is 19 and 8/11, or approximately 19.727.



Wait, but maybe I should verify with another method. Let me use multiplication to check. If I take 19.727... times 22, does it equal 434? Let me compute 19.727 * 22.



First, 19 * 22 = 418. Then, 0.727 * 22. Let me compute 0.727 * 22. 0.7 *22 = 15.4, and 0.027*22=0.594. Adding them together, 15.4 + 0.594 = 15.994. So total is 418 + 15.994 = 433.994, which is approximately 434, considering rounding errors. Therefore, that checks out.



Alternatively, if I use fractions: 19 8/11 * 22. Let's compute that. 19*22 + (8/11)*22. 19*22 is 418, and (8/11)*22 is 8*2 = 16. So total is 418 +16=434. Perfect, that matches. Therefore, the exact value is 19 8/11.



Therefore, the answer is 19 and 8/11, or as a decimal approximately 19.727. Since the question didn't specify the format, but in math problems, fractions are often preferred unless stated otherwise. So, the exact answer is 19 8/11, which can also be written as an improper fraction 217/11.



Alternatively, if they want a decimal, it's approximately 19.727... So, depending on the required form. But since the original numbers are integers, the fractional form is likely the expected answer.



Therefore, after all these checks, I can confidently say that 434 divided by 22 is 19 and 8/11.
