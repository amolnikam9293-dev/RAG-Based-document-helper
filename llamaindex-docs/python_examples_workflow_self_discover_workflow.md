# Self-Discover Workflow 
This notebooks shows how to implement [SELF-DISCOVER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03620).
It has two stages for the given task:
  1. STAGE-1:
a. SELECT: Selects subset of reasoning Modules.
b. ADAPT: Adapts selected reasoning modules to the task.
c. IMPLEMENT: It gives reasoning structure for the task.
  2. STAGE-2: Uses the generated reasoning structure for the task to generate an answer.


The implementation is inspired from the [codebase](https://github.com/catid/self-discover)
```


%pip install -U llama-index


```

```


import os





os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="<Your OpenAI API Key>"


```

Since workflows are async first, this all runs fine in a notebook. If you were running in your own code, you would want to use `asyncio.run()` to start an async event loop if one isn’t already running.
```


asyncdefmain():




<async code





if __name__ =="__main__":




import asyncio




asyncio.run(main())


```

## Setup

## Designing the Workflow
[Section titled “Designing the Workflow”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/workflow/self_discover_workflow/#designing-the-workflow)
SELF-DISCOVER consists of the following steps:
  1. Selecting a subset of given reasoning modules.
  2. Refine and adapt the subset of given reasoning modules based on the task.
  3. Create a reasoning structure for the task given the adapted reasoning modules.
  4. Generate a final answer for the task given the reasoning structure.


The following events are needed:
  1. `GetModulesEvent`: Triggered after a subset of modules are retrieved.
  2. `RefineModulesEvent`: Triggered after the modules are refined and adapted to the task.
  3. `ReasoningStructureEvent`: Triggered after the reasoning structure is generated.


```


from llama_index.core.workflow import Event






classGetModulesEvent(Event):




"""Event to get modules."""





task: str




modules: str






classRefineModulesEvent(Event):




"""Event to refine modules."""





task: str




refined_modules: str






classReasoningStructureEvent(Event):




"""Event to create reasoning structure."""





task: str




reasoning_structure: str


```

Below is the code for the SELF-DISCOVER workflow:
```


from llama_index.core.workflow import (

from llama_index.core.llms importLLM

llm: LLM= ev.get("llm")





if task isNoneor llm isNone:

await ctx.store.set("llm", llm)





# format prompt and get result from LLM

## Running the workflow
[Section titled “Running the workflow”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/workflow/self_discover_workflow/#running-the-workflow)
```


from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI





workflow =SelfDiscoverWorkflow()




llm =OpenAI("gpt-4o")


```

```


from IPython.display import display, Markdown





task ="Michael has 15 oranges. He gives 4 oranges to his brother and trades 3 oranges for 6 apples with his neighbor. Later in the day, he realizes some of his oranges are spoiled, so he discards 2 of them. Then, Michael goes to the market and buys 12 more oranges and 5 more apples. If Michael decides to give 2 apples to his friend, how many oranges and apples does Michael have now?"




result =await workflow.run(task=task,llm=llm)




display(Markdown(str(result)))


```

To solve the task of determining how many oranges and apples Michael has now, we will follow the structured reasoning approach and break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. We will update the counts of oranges and apples step by step.
### Step-by-Step Plan:
[Section titled “Step-by-Step Plan:”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/workflow/self_discover_workflow/#step-by-step-plan)
  1. **Initial count of oranges:**
     * Michael starts with 15 oranges.
     * ( \text{Oranges} = 15 )
  2. **Oranges given to his brother:**
     * Michael gives 4 oranges to his brother.
     * ( \text{Oranges} = 15 - 4 = 11 )
  3. **Oranges traded for apples:**
     * Michael trades 3 oranges for 6 apples.
     * ( \text{Oranges} = 11 - 3 = 8 )
     * ( \text{Apples} = 0 + 6 = 6 )
  4. **Spoiled oranges discarded:**
     * Michael discards 2 spoiled oranges.
     * ( \text{Oranges} = 8 - 2 = 6 )
  5. **Oranges bought at the market:**
     * Michael buys 12 more oranges.
     * ( \text{Oranges} = 6 + 12 = 18 )
  6. **Initial count of apples:**
     * Michael initially had no apples.
     * ( \text{Apples} = 6 ) (from the trade)
  7. **Apples bought at the market:**
     * Michael buys 5 more apples.
     * ( \text{Apples} = 6 + 5 = 11 )
  8. **Apples given to his friend:**
     * Michael gives 2 apples to his friend.
     * ( \text{Apples} = 11 - 2 = 9 )


### Final counts:
[Section titled “Final counts:”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/workflow/self_discover_workflow/#final-counts)
  * **Oranges:** 18
  * **Apples:** 9


Therefore, Michael has 18 oranges and 9 apples now.
