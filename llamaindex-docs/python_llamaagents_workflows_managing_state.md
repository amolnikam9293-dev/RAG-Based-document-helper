# Managing State
By default, workflows automatically initialize and untyped state store. You can access this as needed to share information between workflow steps through the `Context` object.
```


from workflows import Workflow, Context, step




from workflows.events import StartEvent, StopEvent





classMyWorkflow(Workflow):





@step




asyncdefmy_step(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:




current_count =await ctx.store.get("count",default=0)




current_count +=1




await ctx.store.set("count", current_count)




returnStopEvent()


```

## Locking the State
[Section titled “Locking the State”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/managing_state/#locking-the-state)
There are cases where the state might be manipulated by multiple steps running at the same time. In these cases, in can be useful **lock** the state to prevent race conditions. You can do this by using the `Context` object’s `edit_state` method:
```

@step



asyncdefmy_step(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:




# No other steps can access the state while the `with` block is running




asyncwith ctx.store.edit_state() as ctx_state:




if"count"notin state:




ctx_state["count"] =0




ctx_state["count"] +=1




returnStopEvent()


```

## Adding Typed State
[Section titled “Adding Typed State”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/managing_state/#adding-typed-state)
Often, you’ll have some pre-set shape that you want to use as the state for your workflow. The best way to do this is to use a `Pydantic` model to define the state. This way, you:
  * Get type hints for your state
  * Get automatic validation of your state
  * (Optionally) Have full control over the serialization and deserialization of your state using [validators](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/) and [serializers](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/serialization/#custom-serializers)


**NOTE:** You should use a pydantic model that has defaults for all fields. This enables the `Context` object to automatically initialize the state with the defaults.
Here’s a quick example of how you can leverage workflows + pydantic to take advantage of all these features:
```


from pydantic import BaseModel, Field






classCounterState(BaseModel):




count: int=Field(default=0)


```

Then, simply annotate your workflow state with the state model:
```


from workflows import Workflow, step




from workflows.events import (




StartEvent,




StopEvent,







classMyWorkflow(Workflow):




@step




asyncdefstart(




self,




ctx: Context[CounterState],




ev: StartEvent




) -> StopEvent:




# Allows for atomic state updates




asyncwith ctx.store.edit_state() as ctx_state:




ctx_state.count +=1





returnStopEvent(result="Done!")


```

## Maintaining Context Across Runs
[Section titled “Maintaining Context Across Runs”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/managing_state/#maintaining-context-across-runs)
As you have seen, workflows have a `Context` object that can be used to maintain state across steps.
If you want to maintain state across multiple runs of a workflow, you can pass a previous context into the `.run()` method.
```


workflow =MyWorkflow()




ctx =Context(workflow)





handler = workflow.run=ctx)




result =await handler




# Optional: save the ctx somewhere and restore


# ctx_dict = ctx.to_dict()


# ctx = Context.from_dict(workflow, ctx_dict)



# continue with next run



handler = w.run=ctx)




result =await handler


```
