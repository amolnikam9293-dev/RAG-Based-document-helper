from llama_index.llms.lmstudio import LMStudio




from llama_index.core.base.llms.types import ChatMessage, MessageRole


```

```


llm =LMStudio(

```

```


response = llm.complete("Hey there, what is 2+2?")




print(str(response))


```

```

The result of 2 + 2 is 4.

```

```

# use llm.stream_complete



response = llm.stream_complete("What is 7+3?")




forin response:




print(r.delta,end="")


```

```

The result of 7 + 3 is 10.
