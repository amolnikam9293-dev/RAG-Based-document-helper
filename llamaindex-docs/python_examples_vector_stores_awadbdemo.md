```

```


display(Markdown(f"<b>{response}</b>"))


```

**Growing up, the author wrote short stories, experimented with programming on an IBM 1401, nagged his father to buy a TRS-80 computer, wrote simple games, a program to predict how high his model rockets would fly, and a word processor. He also studied philosophy in college, switched to AI, and worked on building the infrastructure of the web. He wrote essays and published them online, had dinners for a group of friends every Thursday night, painted, and bought a building in Cambridge.**
