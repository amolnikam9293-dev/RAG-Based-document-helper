# Customizing entry and exit points
Most of the times, relying on the default entry and exit points we have seen in the [Getting Started](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/) section is enough. However, workflows support custom events where you normally would expect `StartEvent` and `StopEvent`, let’s see how.
## Using a custom `StartEvent`
[Section titled “Using a custom StartEvent”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/customizing_entry_exit_points/#using-a-custom-startevent)
When we call the `run()` method on a workflow instance, the keyword arguments passed become fields of a `StartEvent` instance that’s automatically created under the hood. In case we want to pass complex data to start a workflow, this approach might become cumbersome, and it’s when we can introduce a custom start event.
To be able to use a custom start event, the first step is creating a custom class that inherits from `StartEvent`:
```


from pathlib import Path





from workflows.events import StartEvent




from llama_index.indices.managed.llama_cloud import LlamaCloudIndex




from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI






classMyCustomStartEvent(StartEvent):




a_string_field: str




a_path_to_somewhere: Path




an_index: LlamaCloudIndex




an_llm: OpenAI


```

All we have to do now is using `MyCustomStartEvent` as event type in the steps that act as entry points. Take this artificially complex step for example:
```


classJokeFlow(Workflow):






@step




asyncdefgenerate_joke_from_index(




self, ev: MyCustomStartEvent




) -> JokeEvent:




# Build a query engine using the index and the llm from the start event




query_engine = ev.an_index.as_query_engine=ev.an_llm)




topic =await query_engine.aquery(




f"What is the closest topic to {a_string_field}"





# Use the llm attached to the start event to instruct the model




prompt =f"Write your best joke about {topic}."




response =await ev.an_llm.acomplete(prompt)




# Dump the response on disk using the Path object from the event




ev.a_path_to_somewhere.write_text(str(response))




# Finally, pass the JokeEvent along




returnJokeEvent(joke=str(response))


```

We could still pass the fields of `MyCustomStartEvent` as keyword arguments to the `run` method of our workflow, but that would be, again, cumbersome. A better approach is to use pass the event instance through the `start_event` keyword argument like this:
```


custom_start_event =MyCustomStartEvent(...)




w =JokeFlow(timeout=60,verbose=False)




result =await w.run(start_event=custom_start_event)




print(str(result))


```

This approach makes the code cleaner and more explicit and allows autocompletion in IDEs to work properly.
## Using a custom `StopEvent`
[Section titled “Using a custom StopEvent”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/customizing_entry_exit_points/#using-a-custom-stopevent)
Similarly to `StartEvent`, relying on the built-in `StopEvent` works most of the times but not always. In fact, when we use `StopEvent`, the result of a workflow must be set to the `result` field of the event instance. Since a result can be any Python object, the `result` field of `StopEvent` is typed as `Any`, losing any advantage from the typing system. Additionally, returning more than one object is cumbersome: we usually stuff a bunch of unrelated objects into a dictionary that we then assign to `StopEvent.result`.
First step to support custom stop events, we need to create a subclass of `StopEvent`:
```


from workflows.events import StopEvent






classMyStopEvent(StopEvent):




critique: CompletionResponse


```

We can now replace `StopEvent` with `MyStopEvent` in our workflow:
```


classJokeFlow(Workflow):






@step




asyncdefcritique_joke(self, ev: JokeEvent) -> MyStopEvent:




joke = ev.joke





prompt =f"Give a thorough analysis and critique of the following joke: {joke}"




response =awaitself.llm.acomplete(prompt)




returnMyStopEvent(response)




```

The one important thing we need to remember when using a custom stop events, is that the result of a workflow run will be the instance of the event:
```


w =JokeFlow(timeout=60,verbose=False)



# Warning! `result` now contains an instance of MyStopEvent!



result =await w.run(topic="pirates")



# We can now access the event fields as any normal Event



print(result.critique.text)


```

This approach takes advantage of the Python typing system, is friendly to autocompletion in IDEs and allows introspection from outer applications that now know exactly what a workflow run will return.
