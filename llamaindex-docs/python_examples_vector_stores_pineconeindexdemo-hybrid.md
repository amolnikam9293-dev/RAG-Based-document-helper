# Pinecone Vector Store - Hybrid Search 
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
```


%pip install llama-index-vector-stores-pinecone "transformers[torch]"


```

#### Creating a Pinecone Index
[Section titled “Creating a Pinecone Index”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/vector_stores/pineconeindexdemo-hybrid/#creating-a-pinecone-index)
```


from pinecone import Pinecone, ServerlessSpec


```

```


import os





os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"] ="..."




os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="sk-..."





api_key = os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"]





pc =Pinecone(api_key=api_key)


```

```

# delete if needed



pc.delete_index("quickstart")


```

```

# dimensions are for text-embedding-ada-002



# NOTE: needs dotproduct for hybrid search





pc.create_index(




name="quickstart",




dimension=1536,




metric="dotproduct",




spec=ServerlessSpec(cloud="aws",region="us-east-1"),





# If you need to create a PodBased Pinecone index, you could alternatively do this:



# from pinecone import Pinecone, PodSpec



# pc = Pinecone(api_key='xxx')



# pc.create_index(


#    name='my-index',


#    dimension=1536,


#    metric='cosine',


#    spec=PodSpec(


#      environment='us-east1-gcp',


#      pod_type='p1.x1',


#      pods=1


#    )


# )


```

```


pinecone_index = pc.Index("quickstart")


```

#### Load documents, build the PineconeVectorStore
[Section titled “Load documents, build the PineconeVectorStore”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/vector_stores/pineconeindexdemo-hybrid/#load-documents-build-the-pineconevectorstore)
When `add_sparse_vector=True`, the `PineconeVectorStore` will compute sparse vectors for each document.
By default, it is using simple token frequency for the sparse vectors. But, you can also specify a custom sparse embedding model.
```


from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader




from llama_index.vector_stores.pinecone import PineconeVectorStore




from IPython.display import Markdown, display


```

```

# load documents



documents =SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham/").load_data()


```

```

# set add_sparse_vector=True to compute sparse vectors during upsert



from llama_index.core import StorageContext





if"OPENAI_API_KEY"notin os.environ:




raiseEnvironmentError(f"Environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY is not set")





vector_store =PineconeVectorStore(




pinecone_index=pinecone_index,




add_sparse_vector=True,





storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)




index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(




documents,storage_context=storage_context



```

```

huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used. Disabling parallelism to avoid deadlocks...


To disable this warning, you can either:



- Avoid using `tokenizers` before the fork if possible




- Explicitly set the environment variable TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=(true | false)

#### Query Index
[Section titled “Query Index”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/vector_stores/pineconeindexdemo-hybrid/#query-index)
May need to wait a minute or two for the index to be ready
```

# set Logging to DEBUG for more detailed outputs



query_engine = index.as_query_engine(vector_store_query_mode="hybrid")




response = query_engine.query("What happened at Viaweb?")


```

```


display(Markdown(f"<b>{response}</b>"))


```

**Paul Graham started Viaweb because he needed money. As the company grew, he realized he didn’t want to run a big company and decided to build a subset of the vision as an open source project. Eventually, Viaweb was bought by Yahoo in the summer of 1998, which was a huge relief for Paul Graham.**
## Changing the sparse embedding model
[Section titled “Changing the sparse embedding model”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/vector_stores/pineconeindexdemo-hybrid/#changing-the-sparse-embedding-model)
```


%pip install llama-index-sparse-embeddings-fastembed


```

```

# Clear the vector store



vector_store.clear()


```

```


from llama_index.sparse_embeddings.fastembed import FastEmbedSparseEmbedding





sparse_embedding_model =FastEmbedSparseEmbedding(




model_name="prithivida/Splade_PP_en_v1"

pinecone_index=pinecone_index,




add_sparse_vector=True,

**Paul Graham started Viaweb because he needed money. He recruited a team to work on building software and services, with a focus on creating an application builder and network infrastructure. However, halfway through the summer, Paul realized he didn’t want to run a big company and decided to shift his focus to building a subset of the project as an open source project. This led to the development of a new dialect of Lisp called Arc. Ultimately, Viaweb was sold to Yahoo in the summer of 1998, providing relief to Paul Graham and allowing him to transition to a new phase in his life.**
