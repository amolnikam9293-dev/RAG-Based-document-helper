# Vectara Managed Index 
In this notebook we are going to show how to use [Vectara](https://vectara.com) with LlamaIndex. Please note that this notebook is for Vectara ManagedIndex versions >=0.4.0.
[Vectara](https://vectara.com/) is the trusted AI Assistant and Agent platform which focuses on enterprise readiness for mission-critical applications.
Vectara provides an end-to-end managed service for Retrieval Augmented Generation or [RAG](https://vectara.com/grounded-generation/), which includes:
  1. An integrated API for processing input data, including text extraction from documents and ML-based chunking.
  2. The state-of-the-art [Boomerang](https://vectara.com/how-boomerang-takes-retrieval-augmented-generation-to-the-next-level-via-grounded-generation/) embeddings model. Each text chunk is encoded into a vector embedding using Boomerang, and stored in the Vectara internal knowledge (vector+text) store. Thus, when using Vectara with LlamaIndex you do not need to call a separate embedding model - this happens automatically within the Vectara backend.
  3. A query service that automatically encodes the query into embeddings and retrieves the most relevant text segmentsthrough [hybrid search](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/lexical-matching) and a variety of [reranking](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/reranking) strategies, including a [multilingual reranker](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/vectara-multi-lingual-reranker), [maximal marginal relevance (MMR) reranker](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/mmr-reranker), [user-defined function reranker](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/user-defined-function-reranker), and a [chain reranker](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/chain-reranker) that provides a way to chain together multiple reranking methods to achieve better control over the reranking, combining the strengths of various reranking methods.
  4. An option to create a [generative summary](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/grounded-generation/grounded-generation-overview) with a wide selection of LLM summarizers (including Vectara’s [Mockingbird](https://vectara.com/blog/mockingbird-is-a-rag-specific-llm-that-beats-gpt-4-gemini-1-5-pro-in-rag-output-quality/), trained specifically for RAG-based tasks), based on the retrieved documents, including citations.


See the [Vectara API documentation](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/) for more information on how to use the API.
The main benefits of using Vectara RAG-as-a-service to build your application are:
  * **Accuracy and Quality** : Vectara provides an end-to-end platform that focuses on eliminating hallucinations, reducing bias, and safeguarding copyright integrity.
  * **Security** : Vectara’s platform provides acess control—protecting against prompt injection attacks—and meets SOC2 and HIPAA compliance.
  * **Explainability** : Vectara makes it easy to troubleshoot bad results by clearly explaining rephrased queries, LLM prompts, retrieved results, and agent actions.


## Getting Started
[Section titled “Getting Started”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/managed/vectarademo/#getting-started)
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
```


!pip install llama-index llama-index-indices-managed-vectara


```

To get started with Vectara, [sign up](https://vectara.com/integrations/llamaindex) (if you haven’t already) and follow our [quickstart guide](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/quickstart) to create a corpus and an API key.
Once you have these, you can provide them as environment variables `VECTARA_CORPUS_KEY`, and `VECTARA_API_KEY`. Make sure your API key has both query and index permissions.
## RAG with LlamaIndex and Vectara
[Section titled “RAG with LlamaIndex and Vectara”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/managed/vectarademo/#rag-with-llamaindex-and-vectara)
There are a few ways you can index your data into Vectara, including:
  1. With the `from_documents()` or `insert_file()` methods of `VectaraIndex`
  2. Uploading files directly in the [Vectara console](https://console.vectara.com/)
  3. Using Vectara’s [file upload](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/upload-file) or [document index](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/create-corpus-document) APIs
  4. Using [vectara-ingest](https://github.com/vectara/vectara-ingest), an open source crawler/indexer project
  5. Using one of our ingest integration partners like Airbyte, Unstructured or DataVolo.


For this purpose, we will use a simple set of small documents, so using `VectaraIndex` directly for the ingest is good enough.
Let’s ingest the “AI bill of rights” document into our new corpus.
```


from llama_index.indices.managed.vectara import VectaraIndex




import requests





url ="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf"




response = requests.get(url)




local_path ="ai-bill-of-rights.pdf"




withopen(local_path,"wb") asfile:




file.write(response.content)





index =VectaraIndex()




index.insert_file(




local_path,metadata={"name": "AI bill of rights", "year": 2022}



```

```

'ai-bill-of-rights.pdf'

```

### Running single queries with Vectara Query Engine
[Section titled “Running single queries with Vectara Query Engine”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/managed/vectarademo/#running-single-queries-with-vectara-query-engine)
Now that we’ve uploaded the document (or if documents have been uploaded previously) we can go and ask questions directly in LlamaIndex. This activates Vectara’s RAG pipeline.
To use Vectara’s internal LLM for summarization, make sure you specify `summary_enabled=True` when you generate the Query engine. Here’s an example:
```


questions =[




"What are the risks of AI?",




"What should we do to prevent bad actors from using AI?",




"What are the benefits?",



```

```


qe = index.as_query_engine(




n_sentences_before=1,




n_sentences_after=1,




summary_enabled=True,




summary_prompt_name="mockingbird-1.0-2024-07-16",





qe.query(questions[0]).response


```

```

'The risks of AI include biased data and discriminatory outcomes, opaque decision-making processes, and lack of public trust and understanding of algorithmic systems [1]. These risks can have significant impacts on individuals and communities, particularly those who are directly affected by AI systems [5]. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to identify and address potential risks before deployment, and to implement ongoing monitoring and mitigation strategies [2][6]. This includes risk assessments, auditing mechanisms, and public consultation to ensure that AI systems are designed and used in a responsible and transparent manner [2][6]. Additionally, the development of AI systems should be guided by principles that prioritize lawfulness, accuracy, and transparency, and that are regularly monitored and accountable [7].'

```

If you want the response to be returned in streaming mode, simply set `streaming=True`
```


qe = index.as_query_engine(




n_sentences_before=1,




n_sentences_after=1,




summary_enabled=True,




summary_prompt_name="mockingbird-1.0-2024-07-16",




streaming=True,





response = qe.query(questions[0])





response.print_response_stream()


```

```

The risks of AI include biased data and discriminatory outcomes, opaque decision-making processes, and lack of public trust and understanding of algorithmic systems [1]. These risks can have significant impacts on individuals and communities, particularly those who are directly affected by AI systems [5].

```

### Using Vectara Chat
[Section titled “Using Vectara Chat”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/managed/vectarademo/#using-vectara-chat)
Vectara also supports a simple chat mode. In this mode the chat history is maintained by Vectara and so you don’t have to worry about it. To use it simple call `as_chat_engine`.
(Chat mode always uses Vectara’s summarization so you don’t have to explicitly specify `summary_enabled=True` like before)
```


ce = index.as_chat_engine(n_sentences_before=1,n_sentences_after=1)


```

```


forin questions:




print(f"Question: {q}\n")




response = ce.chat(q).response




print(f"Response: {response}\n")


```

```

Question: What are the risks of AI?



Response: The risks of AI include potential biases and discriminatory outcomes due to biased data, opaque decision-making processes, and lack of public trust and understanding of algorithmic systems. Mitigating these risks involves ongoing transparency, participatory design, explanations for stakeholders, and public consultation [1]. Industry is developing innovative solutions like risk assessments, auditing mechanisms, and monitoring tools to ensure the safety and efficacy of AI systems [2]. Identifying and mitigating risks before deployment is crucial, focusing on impacts on rights, opportunities, and communities, as well as risks from misuse of the system [6]. The Executive Order on Trustworthy AI in the Federal Government outlines principles for lawful, purposeful, accurate, safe, understandable, responsible, monitored, transparent, and accountable AI use [7].



Question: What should we do to prevent bad actors from using AI?



Response: To prevent bad actors from using AI, we should implement a set of principles and practices to ensure the safe and effective use of AI systems. This includes adhering to specific principles such as legality, respect for values, accuracy, reliability, safety, transparency, and accountability in the design and use of AI [2]. Additionally, entities should follow privacy and security best practices to prevent data leaks and employ audits and impact assessments to identify and mitigate algorithmic discrimination [3][4]. It is crucial to involve the public in discussions about the promises and potential harms of AI technologies to shape policies that protect against discrimination and ensure fairness in the use of automated systems [1][6][7]. By promoting transparency, ongoing monitoring, and public consultation, we can work towards building trust, understanding, and ethical use of AI while safeguarding against misuse by bad actors.



Question: What are the benefits?



Response: The benefits of AI include the potential to build innovative infrastructure, improve customer service through faster responses, and enhance decision-making processes. AI can also lead to transformative improvements in people's lives, protect individuals from potential harms, and ensure the ethical use of automated systems. By incorporating principles for responsible stewardship and trustworthy AI, companies and government agencies can create safe, effective, and transparent AI systems that respect values, ensure accuracy, and promote accountability [1][4][6][7].

```

Of course streaming works as well with Chat:
```


ce = index.as_chat_engine(




n_sentences_before=1,n_sentences_after=1,streaming=True



```

```


response = ce.stream_chat("Will artificial intelligence rule the government?")





response.print_response_stream()


```

```

Artificial intelligence will not rule the government. The government has established principles and guidelines for the ethical use of AI, ensuring it is used responsibly, lawfully, and in alignment with the nation's values. These principles emphasize safety, accountability, transparency, and regular monitoring of AI systems within the federal government [1] [2]. Additionally, there are specific considerations for law enforcement and national security activities, highlighting the need for oversight and adherence to existing policies and safeguards [3]. The government is focused on promoting equity, fairness, civil rights, and racial justice through the use of AI, guided by principles that protect the American public [5]. Transparency and accountability are key aspects to ensure that AI technologies are used in ways that respect people's rights and expectations [7].

### Agentic RAG
[Section titled “Agentic RAG”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/managed/vectarademo/#agentic-rag)
Vectara also has its own package, [vectara-agentic](https://github.com/vectara/py-vectara-agentic), built on top of many features from LlamaIndex to easily implement agentic RAG applications. It allows you to create your own AI assistant with RAG query tools and other custom tools, such as making API calls to retrieve information from financial websites. You can find the full documentation for vectara-agentic [here](https://vectara.github.io/vectara-agentic-docs/).
Let’s create a ReAct Agent with a single RAG tool using vectara-agentic (to create a ReAct agent, specify `VECTARA_AGENTIC_AGENT_TYPE` as `"REACT"` in your environment).
Vectara does not yet have an LLM capable of acting as an agent for planning and tool use, so we will need to use another LLM as the driver of the agent resoning.
In this demo, we are using OpenAI’s GPT4o. Please make sure you have `OPENAI_API_KEY` defined in your environment or specify another LLM with the corresponding key (for the full list of supported LLMs, check out our [documentation](https://vectara.github.io/vectara-agentic-docs/introduction.html#try-it-yourself) for setting up your environment).
```


!pip install -U vectara-agentic


```

```


from vectara_agentic.agent import Agent




from IPython.display import display, Markdown





agent = Agent.from_corpus(




tool_name="query_ai",




data_description="AI regulations",




assistant_specialty="artificial intelligence",




vectara_reranker="mmr",




vectara_rerank_k=50,




vectara_summary_num_results=5,




vectara_summarizer="mockingbird-1.0-2024-07-16",




verbose=True,






response = agent.chat(




"What are the risks of AI? What are the benefits? Compare and contrast and provide a summary with arguments for and against from experts."






display(Markdown(response))
