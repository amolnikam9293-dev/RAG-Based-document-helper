# auth env
Manage environments (distinct control plane API URLs). Environments determine which profiles are shown and where auth/project actions apply.
## Usage
[Section titled “Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/llamactl-reference/commands-auth-env/#usage)
Terminal window```


llamactlauthenv [COMMAND] [options]


```

Commands:
  * `list`: List known environments and mark the current one
  * `add <API_URL> [--interactive/--no-interactive]`: Probe the server and upsert the environment
  * `switch [API_URL] [--interactive/--no-interactive]`: Select the current environment (prompts if omitted)
  * `delete [API_URL] [--interactive/--no-interactive]`: Remove an environment and its associated profiles


Notes:
  * Probing reads `requires_auth` and `min_llamactl_version` from the server version endpoint.
  * Switching environment filters profiles shown by `llamactl auth list` and used by other commands.
