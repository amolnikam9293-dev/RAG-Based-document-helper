```

## Image Support
[Section titled “Image Support”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/openai/#image-support)
OpenAI has support for images in the input of chat messages for many models.
Using the content blocks feature of chat messages, you can easily combone text and images in a single LLM prompt.
```


!wget https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/07/07/16/46/dice-1502706_640.jpg -O image.png


```

```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage, TextBlock, ImageBlock




from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI





llm =OpenAI(model="gpt-4o")





messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="user",




blocks=[




ImageBlock(path="image.png"),




TextBlock(text="Describe the image in a few sentences."),








resp = llm.chat(messages)




print(resp.message.content)


```

```

The image is a black and white photograph featuring three dice in mid-air above a checkered surface, likely a chessboard. The dice are captured in motion, with one showing the number five prominently. The background is dark, with a subtle light beam creating a triangular shape above the dice, adding a dramatic effect to the composition.

```

## Audio Support
[Section titled “Audio Support”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/openai/#audio-support)
OpenAI has beta support for audio inputs and outputs, using their audio-preview models.
When using these models, you can configure the output modality (text or audio) using the `modalities` parameter. The output audio configuration can also be set using the `audio_config` parameter. See the [OpenAI docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio) for more information.
```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage




from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI






llm =OpenAI(




model="gpt-4o-audio-preview",




modalities=["text", "audio"],




audio_config={"voice": "alloy", "format": "wav"},






messages =[




ChatMessage(role="user",content="Hello! My name is Logan."),






resp = llm.chat(messages)


```

```


import base64




from IPython.display import Audio





Audio(base64.b64decode(resp.message.blocks[0].audio),rate=16000)


```

Your browser does not support the audio element. 
```

# Add the response to the chat history and ask for the user's name



messages.append(resp.message)




messages.append(ChatMessage(role="user",content="What is my name?"))





resp = llm.chat(messages)




Audio(base64.b64decode(resp.message.blocks[0].audio),rate=16000)


```

Your browser does not support the audio element. 
We can also use audio as input and get descriptions or transcriptions of the audio.
```


!wget AUDIO_URL="https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/sounds-of-mars-one-small-step-earth.wav"-O audio.wav


```

```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage, AudioBlock, TextBlock





messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="user",




blocks=[




AudioBlock(path="audio.wav",format="wav"),




TextBlock(




text="Describe the audio in a few sentences. What is it from?"









llm =OpenAI(




model="gpt-4o-audio-preview",




modalities=["text"],






resp = llm.chat(messages)




print(resp)


```

```

assistant: The audio is a famous quote from astronaut Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969. As he became the first human to step onto the moon's surface, he said, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." This moment marked a significant achievement in space exploration and human history.

```

## Using Function/Tool Calling
[Section titled “Using Function/Tool Calling”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/openai/#using-functiontool-calling)
OpenAI models have native support for function calling. This conveniently integrates with LlamaIndex tool abstractions, letting you plug in any arbitrary Python function to the LLM.
In the example below, we define a function to generate a Song object.
```


from pydantic import BaseModel




from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool






classSong(BaseModel):




"""A song with name and artist"""





name: str




artist: str






defgenerate_song(name: str, artist: str) -> Song:




"""Generates a song with provided name and artist."""




returnSong(name=name,artist=artist)






tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults=generate_song)


```

The `strict` parameter tells OpenAI whether or not to use constrained sampling when generating tool calls/structured outputs. This means that the generated tool call schema will always contain the expected fields.
Since this seems to increase latency, it defaults to false.
```


from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI





llm =OpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini",strict=True)




response = llm.predict_and_call(




[tool],




"Pick a random song for me",




# strict=True  # can also be set at the function level to override the class





print(str(response))


```

```

name='Random Vibes' artist='DJ Chill'

```

We can also do multiple function calling.
```


llm =OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")




response = llm.predict_and_call(




[tool],




"Generate five songs from the Beatles",




allow_parallel_tool_calls=True,





forin response.sources:




print(f"Name: {s.tool_name}, Input: {s.raw_input}, Output: (s)}")


```

```

Name: generate_song, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'name': 'Hey Jude', 'artist': 'The Beatles'}}, Output: name='Hey Jude' artist='The Beatles'


Name: generate_song, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'name': 'Let It Be', 'artist': 'The Beatles'}}, Output: name='Let It Be' artist='The Beatles'


Name: generate_song, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'name': 'Yesterday', 'artist': 'The Beatles'}}, Output: name='Yesterday' artist='The Beatles'


Name: generate_song, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'name': 'Come Together', 'artist': 'The Beatles'}}, Output: name='Come Together' artist='The Beatles'


Name: generate_song, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'name': 'Help!', 'artist': 'The Beatles'}}, Output: name='Help!' artist='The Beatles'

```

### Manual Tool Calling
[Section titled “Manual Tool Calling”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/openai/#manual-tool-calling)
If you want to control how a tool is called, you can also split the tool calling and tool selection into their own steps.
First, lets select a tool.
```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





chat_history =[ChatMessage(role="user",content="Pick a random song for me")]





resp = llm.chat_with_tools([tool],chat_history=chat_history)


```

Now, lets call the tool the LLM selected (if any).
If there was a tool call, we should send the results to the LLM to generate the final response (or another tool call!).
```


tools_by_name = {t.metadata.name: t forin[tool]}




tool_calls = llm.get_tool_calls_from_response(




resp,error_on_no_tool_call=False






while tool_calls:




# add the LLM's response to the chat history




chat_history.append(resp.message)





for tool_call in tool_calls:




tool_name = tool_call.tool_name




tool_kwargs = tool_call.tool_kwargs





print(f"Calling {tool_name} with {tool_kwargs}")




tool_output =tool(**tool_kwargs)




chat_history.append(




ChatMessage(




role="tool",




content=str(tool_output),




# most LLMs like OpenAI need to know the tool call id




additional_kwargs={"tool_call_id": tool_call.tool_id},







resp = llm.chat_with_tools([tool],chat_history=chat_history)




tool_calls = llm.get_tool_calls_from_response(




resp,error_on_no_tool_call=False



```

```

Calling generate_song with {'name': 'Random Vibes', 'artist': 'DJ Chill'}

```

Now, we should have a final response!
```


print(resp.message.content)


```

```

Here's a random song for you: **"Random Vibes"** by **DJ Chill**. Enjoy!

```

## Structured Prediction
[Section titled “Structured Prediction”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/openai/#structured-prediction)
An important use case for function calling is extracting structured objects. LlamaIndex provides an intuitive interface for converting any LLM into a structured LLM - simply define the target Pydantic class (can be nested), and given a prompt, we extract out the desired object.
```


from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI




from llama_index.core.prompts import PromptTemplate




from pydantic import BaseModel




from typing import List






classMenuItem(BaseModel):




"""A menu item in a restaurant."""





course_name: str




is_vegetarian: bool






classRestaurant(BaseModel):




"""A restaurant with name, city, and cuisine."""





name: str




city: str




cuisine: str




menu_items: List[MenuItem]






llm =OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")




prompt_tmpl =PromptTemplate(




"Generate a restaurant in a given city {city_name}"




# Option 1: Use `as_structured_llm`



restaurant_obj = (




llm.as_structured_llm(Restaurant)




.complete(prompt_tmpl.format(city_name="Dallas"))




.raw




# Option 2: Use `structured_predict`


# restaurant_obj = llm.structured_predict(Restaurant, prompt_tmpl, city_name="Miami")

```

```

restaurant_obj

```

```

Restaurant(name='Tasty Bites', city='Dallas', cuisine='Italian', menu_items=[MenuItem(course_name='Appetizer', is_vegetarian=True), MenuItem(course_name='Main Course', is_vegetarian=False), MenuItem(course_name='Dessert', is_vegetarian=True)])

```

#### Structured Prediction with Streaming
[Section titled “Structured Prediction with Streaming”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/openai/#structured-prediction-with-streaming)
Any LLM wrapped with `as_structured_llm` supports streaming through `stream_chat`.
```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage




from IPython.display import clear_output




from pprint import pprint





input_msg = ChatMessage.from_str("Generate a restaurant in Boston")





sllm = llm.as_structured_llm(Restaurant)




stream_output = sllm.stream_chat([input_msg])




for partial_output in stream_output:




clear_output(wait=True)




pprint(partial_output.raw.dict())




restaurant_obj = partial_output.raw




restaurant_obj

```

```

{'city': 'Boston',



'cuisine': 'American',




'menu_items': [{'course_name': 'Appetizer', 'is_vegetarian': True},




{'course_name': 'Main Course', 'is_vegetarian': False},




{'course_name': 'Dessert', 'is_vegetarian': True}],




'name': 'Boston Bites'}








Restaurant(name='Boston Bites', city='Boston', cuisine='American', menu_items=[MenuItem(course_name='Appetizer', is_vegetarian=True), MenuItem(course_name='Main Course', is_vegetarian=False), MenuItem(course_name='Dessert', is_vegetarian=True)])

```

## Set API Key at a per-instance level
[Section titled “Set API Key at a per-instance level”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/openai/#set-api-key-at-a-per-instance-level)
If desired, you can have separate LLM instances use separate API keys.
```


from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI





llm =OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo",api_key="BAD_KEY")




resp = llm.complete("Paul Graham is ")




print(resp)


```

```

Graham has also written several influential essays on startups and entrepreneurship, which have gained a wide following in the tech industry. He has been involved in the founding and funding of numerous successful startups, including Reddit, Dropbox, and Airbnb. Graham is known for his insightful and often controversial opinions on various topics, including education, inequality, and the future of technology.

```

## Additional kwargs
[Section titled “Additional kwargs”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/openai/#additional-kwargs)
Rather than adding same parameters to each chat or completion call, you can set them at a per-instance level with `additional_kwargs`.
```


from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI





llm =OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo",additional_kwargs={"user": "your_user_id"})




resp = llm.complete("Paul Graham is ")




print(resp)


```

```


from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI





llm =OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo",additional_kwargs={"user": "your_user_id"})




messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="system",content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(role="user",content="What is your name"),





resp = llm.chat(messages)


```
