# DeepSeek 
# LlamaIndex Llms Integration: DeepSeek
[Section titled “LlamaIndex Llms Integration: DeepSeek”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/deepseek/#llamaindex-llms-integration-deepseek)
This is the DeepSeek integration for LlamaIndex. Visit [DeepSeek](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/) for information on how to get an API key and which models are supported.
At the time of writing, you can use:
  * `deepseek-chat`
  * `deepseek-reasoner`


## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/deepseek/#setup)
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
```


%pip install llama-index-llms-deepseek


```

```


from llama_index.llms.deepseek import DeepSeek




# you can also set DEEPSEEK_API_KEY in your environment variables



llm =DeepSeek(model="deepseek-reasoner",api_key="you_api_key")




# You might also want to set deepseek as your default llm


# from llama_index.core import Settings


# Settings.llm = llm

```

```


response = llm.complete("Is 9.9 or 9.11 bigger?")


```

```


print(response)


```

```

To determine whether 9.9 or 9.11 is larger, compare them by aligning their decimal places:



1. **Write both numbers with the same number of decimal places**:



- \(9.9\) becomes \(9.90\).




- \(9.11\) remains \(9.11\).




2. **Compare digit by digit**:



- **Units place**: Both have \(9\) (equal).




- **Tenths place**: \(9\) (in \(9.90\)) vs. \(1\) (in \(9.11\)). Since \(9 > 1\), \(9.90 > 9.11\).




**Conclusion**:


\(9.9\) (or \(9.90\)) is greater than \(9.11\).



\(\boxed{9.9}\)

#### Call `chat` with a list of messages
[Section titled “Call chat with a list of messages”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/deepseek/#call-chat-with-a-list-of-messages)
```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="system",content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(




role="user",content="How many 'r's are in the word 'strawberry'?"






resp = llm.chat(messages)


```

```


print(resp)


```

```

assistant: Arrr, matey! Let's plunder the word "strawberry" fer them sneaky 'r's! Here be the breakdown:



**S - T - R - A - W - B - E - R - R - Y**



Shiver me timbers! There be **3 'r's** lurkin' in them letters! Aye, one in "straw" and two in "berry"—just like treasure buried in three chests! 🏴☠️🍓

```

### Streaming
[Section titled “Streaming”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/deepseek/#streaming)
Using `stream_complete` endpoint
```


response = llm.stream_complete("Is 9.9 or 9.11 bigger?")


```

```


forin response:




print(r.delta,end="")


```

```

To determine whether 9.9 or 9.11 is bigger, we can compare them by converting both numbers to have the same number of decimal places.



- 9.9 can be written as 9.90 (adding a zero to make it two decimal places).


- 9.11 is already in two decimal places.



Next, we compare the tenths place:


- 9.90 has a 9 in the tenths place.


- 9.11 has a 1 in the tenths place.



Since 9 is greater than 1, 9.90 is larger than 9.11.



To confirm, we can subtract:


\[ 9.90 - 9.11 = 0.79 \]


The positive result indicates that 9.90 is greater than 9.11.



Another method is converting to fractions:


- 9.9 is \( \frac{99}{10} \) which is equivalent to \( \frac{990}{100} \).


- 9.11 is \( \frac{911}{100} \).



Comparing \( \frac{990}{100} \) and \( \frac{911}{100} \), we see 990 is greater than 911.



Thus, the larger number is \boxed{9.9}.

```

Using `stream_chat` endpoint
```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="system",content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(




role="user",content="How many 'r's are in the word 'strawberry'?"






resp = llm.stream_chat(messages)


```

```


forin resp:




print(r.delta,end="")


```

```

Arrr, matey! Let's plunder the letters o' "strawberry" to count them sneaky 'r's! 🏴☠️



**S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y**


Yarrr, here be the breakdown:



1. **S** 🚫


2. **T** 🚫


3. **R** ✅ (1st 'r')


4. **A** 🚫


5. **W** 🚫


6. **B** 🚫


7. **E** 🚫


8. **R** ✅ (2nd 'r')


9. **R** ✅ (3rd 'r')


10. **Y** 🚫



**Total 'r's: 3**


Shiver me timbers! Three 'r's be lurkin' in "strawberry"! 🍓⚔️
