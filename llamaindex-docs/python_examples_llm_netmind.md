## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/netmind/#setup)
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
```


%pip install llama-index-llms-netmind


```

```


!pip install llama-index


```

```


from llama_index.llms.netmind import NetmindLLM


```

```

None of PyTorch, TensorFlow >= 2.0, or Flax have been found. Models won't be available and only tokenizers, configuration and file/data utilities can be used.

```

```

# set api key in env or in llm


# import os


# os.environ["NETMIND_API_KEY"] = "your api key"




llm =NetmindLLM(




model="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct",api_key="your api key"



```

```


resp = llm.complete("Is 9.9 or 9.11 bigger?")


```

```


print(resp)


```

```

9.11 is bigger than 9.9.

```

#### Call `chat` with a list of messages
[Section titled “Call chat with a list of messages”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/netmind/#call-chat-with-a-list-of-messages)
```

messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="system",content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(role="user",content="What is your name"),





resp = llm.chat(messages)


```

```


print(resp)


```

```
