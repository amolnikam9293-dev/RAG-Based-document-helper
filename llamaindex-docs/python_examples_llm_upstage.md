# Upstage 
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
```


%pip install llama-index-llms-upstage llama-index


```

## Basic Usage
[Section titled “Basic Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/upstage/#basic-usage)
#### Call `complete` with a prompt
[Section titled “Call complete with a prompt”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/upstage/#call-complete-with-a-prompt)
```


import os





os.environ["UPSTAGE_API_KEY"] ="YOUR_API_KEY"


```

```


from llama_index.llms.upstage import Upstage





llm =Upstage(




model="solar-mini",




# api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"  # uses UPSTAGE_API_KEY env var by default






resp = llm.complete("Paul Graham is ")


```

```


print(resp)


```

```

```

#### Call `chat` with a list of messages
[Section titled “Call chat with a list of messages”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/upstage/#call-chat-with-a-list-of-messages)
```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="system",content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(role="user",content="What is your name"),





resp = llm.chat(messages)


```

```


print(resp)


```

```

assistant: I am Captain Redbeard, the fearless pirate!

```

## Streaming
[Section titled “Streaming”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/upstage/#streaming)
Using `stream_complete` endpoint
```


resp = llm.stream_complete("Paul Graham is ")


```

```


forin resp:




print(r.delta,end="")


```

```

Paul Graham is a computer scientist, entrepreneur, and essayist. He is best known for co-founding the startup accelerator Y Combinator, which has helped launch some of the most successful tech companies in the world, including Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe. He is also the author of several influential essays on startup culture and entrepreneurship, including "How to Start a Startup" and "Hackers & Painters."

```

Using `stream_chat` endpoint
```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





messages =[




ChatMessage(




role="system",content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(role="user",content="What is your name"),





resp = llm.stream_chat(messages)


```

```


forin resp:




print(r.delta,end="")


```

```

I am Captain Redbeard, the fearless pirate!

```

## Function Calling
[Section titled “Function Calling”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/upstage/#function-calling)
Upstage models have native support for function calling. This conveniently integrates with LlamaIndex tool abstractions, letting you plug in any arbitrary Python function to the LLM.
```


from pydantic import BaseModel




from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool






classSong(BaseModel):




"""A song with name and artist"""





name: str




artist: str






defgenerate_song(name: str, artist: str) -> Song:




"""Generates a song with provided name and artist."""




returnSong(name=name,artist=artist)






tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults=generate_song)


```

```


from llama_index.llms.upstage import Upstage





llm =Upstage()




response = llm.predict_and_call([tool],"Generate a song")




print(str(response))


```

```

name='My Song' artist='John Doe'

```

We can also do multiple function calling.
```


llm =Upstage()




response = llm.predict_and_call(




[tool],




"Generate five songs from the Beatles",




allow_parallel_tool_calls=True,





forin response.sources:




print(f"Name: {s.tool_name}, Input: {s.raw_input}, Output: (s)}")


```

```

Name: generate_song, Input: {'args': (), 'kwargs': {'name': 'Beatles', 'artist': 'Beatles'}}, Output: name='Beatles' artist='Beatles'

```

## Async
[Section titled “Async”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llm/upstage/#async)
```


from llama_index.llms.upstage import Upstage





llm =Upstage()


```

```


resp =await llm.acomplete("Paul Graham is ")


```

```


print(resp)


```

```

print(str(response))


```

```

name='My Song' artist='Me'

```
